## Content

### Writing

To add content, just go to [the content folder](./content) and add a markdown file under [/posts](./content/posts).

There's also a [template](./content/content-template.md) that you can copy and paste to make sure you don't forget some
fields or how to include something. On the template you can find some hints on writing content as well.

### Adding links to your pages

We have [author tags](./src/components/ContentAuthors) with some other find you can add to the [contributors file](.all-contributorsrc):

1. `twitter`: Twitter
2. `linkedin`: Github
