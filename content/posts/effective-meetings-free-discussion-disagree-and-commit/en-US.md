One key goal to strive in decision-making meetings is providing an environment
of free discussion. People need to feel encouraged and safe to share their
opinions and be assured that **personal views will never outweigh the better
idea**. The greater the disagreement on a topic, the more free the discussion
needs to be. Our shared responsibility is to steer the conversation towards the
most meaningful goals, while still making sure that it is free, and everyone can
voice their opinions.

## The Role of the Moderator

For every meeting, it's useful to have a person who is responsible for leading
it or one for each section separately. This person does not have to be the one
with more knowledge on the subject, but rather the one with more stake in what
is the output of that meeting.

What we're looking for here is someone who understand what is important in the
output. That will ask the right questions. At the same time, the people we need
to be more active are the ones that will actually be engaged in the work. One of
the key roles of such moderator is keeping the discussion on track:

   alt="The free discussion model it shows four quadrants on two axes:
   Participants and moderator the axis go from inactive to active. When the
   participants are active, and the supervisor inactive the discussion is on
   track. When both are inactive, the discussion is sleepy. The moderator
   should become active to put the discussion on track when the participants are
   inactive. When both are active the discussion is off-track."

*The moderator's effort at a meeting should go into keeping the
discussion on track, with the participants bearing the brunt of working the
issues*

In other words, the moderator's goal is **engaging all of the participants and
keeping the discussion on track.** We all come from different backgrounds and
have vastly different experiences. Which means that people will react in
distinct ways to confrontation and to having someone give an opinion on what
they should work on. Dealing with such distinct reactions makes an honest and
meaningful discussion harder to achieve. This sometimes lead people to run away
from having coworkers with diverse backgrounds. This kills diversity and blinds
them to different ideas.

Confrontation & Diversity are essential if we want the best ideas to win. So we
need to be the ones encouraging instead of fighting them. And here are some ways
we can do that:

1. **Ask the right questions at the correct times:** The moderator understands
   what we want as an output, so she should know what questions need to be
   answered by whatever decision is taken from the meeting. Ask honestly curious
   questions, do not make them rhetoric, do not attempt to provide an answer.

2. **Approach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary**: [We hate losing
   more than we like
   winning](https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/prospect_theory.pdf).A
   perceived loss triggers attempts to reestablish fairness through competition,
   criticism, or disengagement, which is a form of workplace-learned
   helplessness. Whenever conflict come, what needs to be on both sides is the
   question ‚ÄúHow could we achieve a mutually desirable outcome?‚Äù

3. **Empathy should be on the table:** We all have needs for respect,
   competence, social status, and autonomy. Recognizing these deeper needs
   naturally elicits trust and promotes positive language and behaviors. **We
   need to anchor everyone on the fact that we have shared goals** we may
   disagree on how to get there, but we're still capable people and want to be
   treated like humans. We're [highly social
   beings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNhk3owF7RQ). We need to understand
   that and value empathy and social skills. Making people understand that
   others have beliefs, hopes and anxieties "Just Like Me" is key to more
   meaningful and rewarding discussions.

4. **When in large groups, always Breakout:** Our anxieties and fears play a
   significant part at making us shy away from giving controversial opinions in
   large groups. We quickly default to the opinion of the majority or of the
   strongest voice. Some people are naturally more assertive and talk more, this
   will inevitably hinder the more introverted participants from sharing their
   true ideas. [Breakout
   Sessions](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-a-breakout-session-1223650#:~:text=A%20breakout%20session%2C%20also%20known,seminar%2C%20conference%2C%20or%20convention.)
   helps us in many ways to deal with this:
   <ol>
      <li>People know they are expected to be active;</li>
      <li>Participants will be encouraged to share their ideas, being less prone to herd mentality and from fear;</li>
      <li>It gives the small groups a sense of "we're in this together" which is useful for empathy and collaboration;</li>
      <li>Allow people some time to work on the issues on their own, less influenced by what is presented. We can also ask people to individually work on the issues before or during the meeting and regroup the ideas later.</li>
   </ol>

If this seems uncannily similar to building [Psychological Safety in your
team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8), it's because it is. The
goals are the same; we want people to feel encouraged to take risks. To bring
something more to the table.

Environments that feel safe, supportive, and nonjudgmental help people find
their voice. It is easier to share when you see that every one else is doing the
same versus just one or two talkative people. Or, when somebody asked for my
opinion because she was genuinely curious or when we have a good enough
relationship with the other folks to know that they wouldn't *actually*
think we are incompetent, even if we say something stupid. Fostering
disagreement will bring the best ideas to the table, but there is one additional
benefit that is even more important.

## Allowing People to Commit to the Decision

Everyone on a team ultimately shares the same goals. While people have different
opinions about the best path to take, part of working well together is placing
trust in decision-makers and in a fair process. If we can perceive the process
as appropriate, we can "Disagree and commit" for the sake of moving forward
quickly.

It's important that everyone involved can give the decision reached by the group
*__full support__*. This does not necessarily mean agreement: so long as the
participants commit to back the decision, that is a satisfactory outcome. If we
can't reach this stage, then we need more free discussion.

   alt="The ideal decision-making process. Shows a state diagram with three
   states: Free Discussion that can transition to Clear Decision. Clear Decision
   can transition to Full Support. If Full support can't be achieved, more free
   discussion is needed"

*The ideal decision-making process.*

The need for Disagreement and Commitment comes from the need for better ideas
and better execution. These are the main reasons why the participants need to be
the ones active in the discussion. When moderating, we must, no matter how hard,
refrain from taking active participation in anything other than making the
participants more engaged and providing useful data. As much as we'd like to
think ours are the best ideas, that is hardly the case. Even when it is, we need
commitment in order to get anything done, so people need to arrive at them and
trust the process. Focus on free discussion, and you will get both.

Yes üòâ , this is very similar to Amazon's [Disagree &
Commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit) leadership principle.
