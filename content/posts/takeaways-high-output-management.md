When I first read High Output Management, I had just become a manager and was
going through the "Everything I am doing is wrong" phase of that process. I had
little experience, very little knowledge and a lot of energy that was being
wasted in the most incredibly misguided ways. If I had gone on without reading
this, I'd definitely have taken a lot more time to understand what I was doing
wrong.

When I started searching for references on learning about management, I quickly
saw that High Output Management had an almost legendary status. It's not a new
book, but somehow has survived the test of time as one of the most recommended
books and is present in almost any list I looked. To quote Ben Horowitz:

> "Over the years, I have come to consider High Output Management a true
> masterpiece, and there are at least three core aspects to its genius. First,
> in as little as one sentence, it lucidly explains concepts that require entire
> books from lesser writers. Second, it consistently uncovers brand-new
> management ideas or finds new insights in old standards. Finally, while most
> management books attempt to teach basic competency, High Output Management
> teaches the reader how to be great."

It's a book that is pleasurable, insightful and rich in substance while also
being very fast to read. I took great value from this book, and that's why I
took the time to organize what were the key takeaways for me as a manager which
I hope can help you become a better manager like they helped me :)

## Takeaway one: Everything is a process

Whether you're building software, hiring, making breakfast, creating toys,
everything can be modeled as a production process. After all, we're always
trying to:

> “Build and deliver products **in response to the demands** of the customer
**at a scheduled delivery time**, at an **acceptable quality level**, and **at
lowest possible cost.**”

Understanding the basis of production will enable you to achieve that goal and
Andrew provides us with some of those key elements.

this topic: ["Everything is a process"](/content/posts/everything-is-a-process).

## Takeaway two: Your output is almost entirely based in leverage

Understanding our output is very important. As Andrew describes it:

> Manager’s Output = The Output of his organization + The Output of the
>     neighboring organizations under his influence

This means that we as managers have to focus on the organizations' outputs, not
our individual ones and stresses the dire need for managers to find leverage.

To put it simply, in order to increase a Manager's productivity--that is, the
output of a manager per unit of time worked--we have three ways:

1. Increase the rate at which a manager performs his activities;
2. Increase the leverage associated with the various managerial activities and
3. Shifting the mix of a manager's activities from those with lower to those
   with higher leverage

Identifying the high leverage activities, then, is key to making ourselves more
productive. We can achieve high leverage in three ways:

1. When many people are affected by one manager;
2. When a person's activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected
   by a manager's brief, well-focused set of words or actions;
3. When a large group's work is affected by an individual supplying a unique,
   key piece of knowledge or information.

Remember, leverage can also be negative. Some activities can end up reducing the
output of the organization. One important example here is *Managerial Meddling*:
when a supervisor uses his superior knowledge and experience of a direct's
responsibilities to assume command of a situation rather than letting the direct
work things through himself.

## Takeaway three: Meetings are a medium of work

Meetings are a powerful way to have leverage if used correctly.

## Summary

In summary, the takeaways are:

1. **Everything is a process**: Find the limiting step and organize the
   production around it. Measure with meaningful indicators. Fix problems while
   they're small and assure quality. Be very critical of your process and
   optimize it diligently;
2. **Your output is almost entirely based in leverage**: Your output is not
   individual anymore, find leverage and multiply the work of others. Manage
   your time; it's the most valuable asset you have.
3. **Meetings are a medium of work**: Meetings are a powerful way to have
   leverage if used correctly. Prepare accordingly, make the roles very clear to
   everyone in the meeting. Enable free discussion and be humble, your team
   often has more perspective than you;
4. **Manage short-term outcomes based on long-term plans**: To understand what
   must be done short-term, we need to look further in the future. Your plan may
   be tossed in the garbage, but the planning process will provide you
5. **Management is not 1-size, fits-all. Manage your team's performance**:
   Understand the shifts in task-relevant-maturity and change the mode of
   control accordingly. Performance is a function of understanding what takes to
   do the work and motivation; find which you can help more with and that will
   give you leverage. No management style will work for everyone.
