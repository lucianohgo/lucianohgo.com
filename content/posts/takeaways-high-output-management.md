> “If you're wrong, you will die. But most companies don't die because they are wrong; most die because they don't commit themselves. They fritter away their valuable resources while attempting to make a decision. The greatest danger is in Standing still”

When I first read High Output Management, I had just become a manager and was going through the "Everything I am doing is wrong" phase of that process. I had little experience, very little knowledge and a lot of energy that was being wasted in the most incredibly misguided ways. If I had gone on without reading this, I'd definitely have taken a lot more time to understand what I was doing wrong.

When I started searching for references on learning about management, I quickly saw that High Output Management had an almost legendary status. It's not a new book, but somehow has survived the test of time as one of the most recommended books and is present in almost any list I looked. To quote Ben Horowitz: "Over the years, I have come to consider High Output Management a true masterpiece, and there are at least three core aspects to its genius. First, in as little as one sentence, it lucidly explains concepts that require entire books from lesser writers. Second, it consistently uncovers brand-new management ideas or finds new insights in old standards. Finally, while most management books attempt to teach basic competency, High Output Management teaches the reader how to be great."

It's a book that is pleasurable to read, insightful and rich in substance while also being very fast to read. I took great value from this book, and that's why I took the time to organize what were the key takeaways for me as a manager which I hope can help you become a better manager like they helped me :)

> I also did a ~very unorganized~ [book summary](./../book-summaries/high-output-management.md) which goes into more detail on each chapter.

- Different people will be better managed differently.

## Summary

In summary, the takeaways are:

1. **Everything is a process**: Find the limiting step and organize the production around it. Measure with meaningful indicators. Fix problems while they're small and assure quality. Be very critical of your process and optimize it diligently;
2. **Your output is almost entirely based in leverage**: Your output is not individual anymore, find leverage and multiply the work of others. Manage your time; it's the most valuable asset you have.
3. **Meetings are a medium of work**: Meetings are a powerful way to have leverage if used correctly. Prepare accordingly, make the roles very clear to everyone in the meeting. Enable free discussion and be humble, your team often has more perspective than you;
4. **Manage short-term outcomes based on long-term plans**: To understand what must be done short-term, we need to look further in the future. Your plan may be tossed in the garbage, but the planning process will provide you
5. **Management is not 1-size, fits-all. Manage your team's performance**: Understand the shifts in task-relevant-maturity and change the mode of control accordingly. Performance is a function of understanding what takes to do the work and motivation; find which you can help more with and that will give you leverage. No management style will work for everyone.
