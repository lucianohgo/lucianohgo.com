This is a template for content you might want to use. Some reminders:

1. Try not to use `<h1 />` headers since the title will have that level and it's not very semantic to have multiple ones;
2. Check your content with the development server by running `yarn dev` so that you don't get surprises;
3. Provide alt, title and captions to all images;

## Code

Code will be automatically syntax highlighted with [Solarized Dark theme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/), we
currently only support:

1. JS and JSX (use `jsx`)
2. TS and TSX (use `tsx`)

If you want to add new languages support include it under [prismjs .babelrc plugin](../.babelrc) and add it here too :)
  
## Tables

Regular markdown tables with caption. Example of a table:

| Question to answer            | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------------  |------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| __Is it happening?__          | Did the navigation start successfully? Has the server responded?  |
| __Is it useful?__             | Has enough content rendered that users can engage with it?        |
| __Is it usable?__             | Can users interact with the page, or is it busy?                  |
| __Is it delightful?__         | Are the interactions smooth and natural, free of lag and jank?    |
