Author: [Mark Horstman](https://g.co/kgs/TRn8XR)*

## Introduction: Who this book is for, What it's about, and Why

This book is about managing people. It's about getting the most out of your
direct reports, for two reasons: *because most managers are very bad at that
part of their job, __yet that's the most valuable thing they do as a manager.__*

Hundreds, if not thousands, of managers describe their "training" this way: "*I
got promoted, and they didn't tell me anything about what I was supposed to do
or how I was supposed to do it. They just gave me a team and wished me luck.*"

The felling you have that others know what they're doing but you don't is wrong.
*Almost everyone else doesn't know either.*

Success at work is about what you *do*--you are your behaviors.

## Chapter One: "What is an Effective Manager?"

*How do you know someone is a good manager? What is the definition of a good
manager?*

Your first responsibility is to *deliver whatever results your organization
expects from you*.

The problem with not having clearly delineated responsibilities is that you
can't make intelligent choices about where to focus. You begin to feel that
"Everything is important."

If you can't list your goals almost off the top of your head, ask your boss:

- "What results do you expect of me?"
- "What are the measures you're going to compare me against?"
- "What are the objective standards?"
- "What subjective things do you look at to round out your evaluation of me?"

[üéß There's a cast for that üëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2016/04/getting-your-goals-your-boss-part-1)

There are always measures. If you don't know what they are, they may be being
used against you.

When the end justify the means for managers, bad things happen to the workers
who report to them. A focus *only* on results far too often leads to abuse of
workers.

### Your Second Responsibility as a Manager is to Retain Your People

Effectively managed modern organizations now measure *retention* in addition to
results when they are evaluating a manager.

For today's manager, it's not enough to get results.

### The Definition of an Effective Manager Is One Who Gets Results and Keeps Her People

*How well did this manager do her job, as shown in her results? Did she retain
her people?*

If you want to be an effective manager and if you want to maximize your job
security and your professional satisfaction, you've got to achieve these two
metrics. You've got to know how your organization measures them, and you've got
to choose to spend your time on things that achieve them.

What are the things that you can DO that are most likely to achieve them?

## Chapter Two: The Four Critical Behaviors

The four critical behaviors that an effective manager engages in to produce
results and retain team members are the following:

1. Get to Know your People
2. Communicate about Performance
3. Ask for More
4. Push Work Down

### The First Critical Behavior: Get to Know your People

The single most important and efficient thing that you can do is to spend time
getting to know the strengths and weaknesses of your direct reports. Managers
who know how to get the most out of each individual member of the team achieve
noticeably better results than managers who don't.

*Every person on the earth expects and deserves to be treated as an individual.*
Sadly, what most managers do is *manage others the way we would like to be
managed.*

People and their behaviors are what deliver results to your organization.
Results are your primary responsibility.

A test for your knowledge on your directs (for most people family > work in
importance):

*What Are the First Names of All of the Children of the People Who Report
Directly to You?*

[üéß There's a cast for that üëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2009/08/direct-relationships-acid-test)

If you failed the test, consider this: what makes you think you can get the last
full measure of devotion to work out of someone when you don't know the names of
the people who are the most precious to them in the world?

You are missing the biggest leverage of all: a trusting relationship with those
whom you manage.

It's not about being "friends". Spending 30 minutes a week with each of your
directs isn't likely to result in your becoming "friends" with them.

Most managers have no idea how *one-sided* their conversations are with their
team members. They have no idea how *little* influence those brief conversations
actually have on building relationships.

Your directs have a different perception of your caring abut them than you think
they have if you generally only ask those questions before you're going to ask
them for something.

Further, you don't realize the extent to which your chit-chat with them is
driven by *you*.

*Your directs don't see you as a nice person. They see you as their boss.*

Our role power as managers affects every interaction we have with our team
members.

Generally, the more a team trusts its manager, the better the results will be,
and the better the retention as well.

If I trust my directs, I can spend less time telling them all the details about
an assignment, checking their work, and asking for voluminous and frequent
reports.

There's more time for results.

#### Trust

The binding and distinctive element of teams that outperform others is the
amount of trust that they build and engender among their members. To get our
group of directs performing more like a team, we've got to develop trusting
relationships with them, despite the effect of your role power.

Building trust starts with communication. **_If you're going to create trust and
trusting relationships with your directs, then, you're going to have to talk to
them frequently about things that are important to them._**

**_Getting to know your directs accounts for 40 percent of the total value
created by engaging in the four critical behaviors._**

The most important thing you can do as a manager is to develop a trusting
relationship with the people on your team. If you do, everything else is easier.
If you don't, everything else is harder, and your results will be attenuated.

### The Second Critical Behavior: Communicate About Performance

*If you want more performance communications from YOUR boss, you know your
directs want the same thing from you.*

When we talk to high-performing directs who rate their boss as outstanding,
performance communications come up over and over again as a core reason.

If you want high performance, you're going to have to talk about it with your
directs. It matters more than anything else, other than your relationship with
them.

**_Performance communication accounts for 30 percent of the total value created
by engaging in the four critical behaviors._**

If you build a great relationship with each of your directs and talk with them
about performance regularly, you're 70 percent of the way.

### The Third Critical Behavior: Ask for more

It's the manager's job to figure out what the external change means for her
group and to direct the performance of her group in ways that satisfy the needs
of the organization.

This may surprise you: as managers, we're *supposed* to stress out our directs.

The ideal place for your directs to be for maximum output/results is right on
the line between distress and eustress, *almost* over the line into fear, but
not quite there. They should have lots of energy, but not panic. The *only way
to know where that line is, for each direct, is to push each direct into moments
of distress and pay attention to when they start to lose effectiveness.*
Everyone has his or her own point of diminishing returns.

The way you do that is to ask for more.

As managers, we're responsible not just for the status quo, but for *improving*
the performance of the whole team. The best way a team's performance improves is
if each individual's performance improves.

So, the direct who says he is happy where he is fine, for now. In a year,
though, his job will have changed enough--and the standards will have risen
enough, because standards are always rising--that *his performance will have
declined relative to the needs of the job.*

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2013/11/my-direct-doesnt-want-change)

To be an effective manager means encouraging and inspiring all of your directs
to higher performance even when they say they don't want to.

**_Asking for more accounts for roughly 15 percent of the total value created by
engaging in the four critical behaviors._**

### The Fourth Critical Behavior: Push Work Down

The first three parts create value for the team, "*pushing work down*" creates
*capacity for the organization.*

*The direct should do the job and not the manager, because the direct is cheaper
labor. If we can achieve an acceptable quality level with less cost, for all but
the most important things we do, we should do so.*

That's not a rude statement--no insult is implied or should be inferred. If you
had a choice of hiring two contractors, or workers of any type, and you knew
they would provide work of roughly equal quality, wouldn't you hire the less
expensive one? Of course you would.

*All workers are busy.* We have to ask ourselves: "What work is most valuable to
the organization?" In general, the more important work of the organization is
being done at higher levels.

What this means for us managers is that we have to learn to share our work with
our directs.

**_Pushing work down accounts for roughly 15 percent of the total value created
by engaging in the four critical behaviors._**

---

That's the "Management Trinity": The four most critical behaviors a manager can
engage in, to produce results and retain team members:

1. Get to Know Your People;
2. Communicate about Performance
3. Ask for More.
4. Push Work Down.

## Chapter Three: Teachable and Sustainable Tools

**However you manage, your techniques, behavior, and philosophy must be both
teachable to others and sustainable.**

It's really not enough for someone merely to get the job done. The team member
has to be able to talk about it, communicate about it, and explain it, and even
defend it if need be. If something goes wrong, you may have to ask that team
member to walk through their process step-by-step as part of a root cause
analysis.

What does it say about the most important systemic behavior in every
organization that the majority of us learned how to do it from others who were
never taught it and who privately worried that others would discover that they
didn't truly know what they were doing?

We need every effective person to think about growing their skills and
influencing more people in the firm. Not everybody wants to be a manager, but if
someone wants to or is willing to consider it, we ought not to discourage that
person. There are all kinds of great managers who are reserved or even shy.
Managing is about results and retention, not about smiling and knowing people.
We can't build on "your personality". That is not "sustainable".

The way an effective manager manages is visible to others and is teachable to
others. And the effective manager can repeat the core behaviors in any
situation, nearly anywhere. We can't teach "personality", and we can't teach "I
don't know".

The way to create new managers is to teach them *before* they move into the
role.

In order to have a teachable management style, Manager Tools started creating
tools for the critical behaviors:

| Critical Behavior             | Manager Tool |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Get to know your people       | One On Ones  |
| Communicate about performance | Feedback     |
| Ask for More                  | Coaching     |
| Push Work Down                | Delegation   |

## Chapter Four: Know Your People--One on Ones

A Manager Tools One on One is a meeting that:

- Is scheduled
- Held Weekly
- That lasts 30 minutes
- That is held with each of your directs
- In which the direct's issues are primary
- In which the manager takes notes

### Scheduled

Scheduling your O3s is actually more important than having them weekly.

Scheduling is saying to your directs:

> "You're always going to have time with me. I'm always going to be investing in
> the relationship."

If you don't schedule your O3s, you're saying:

> "This might be important in a given week. You might be important, and the time
> with me might be valuable. I don't know. Let's play it by ear. We'll see how
> things go."

Directs see this as:

1. "My boos is saying I'm important";
2. "I have time to prepare".

#### "My Boss is Saying I'm Important"

When you tell your directs that they're going to have scheduled time with you
every week, no matter what, you elevate their importance to that of the rest of
the items on your calendar; That is you are making them also "important"

There's a difference in how important you think they are, and how important they
think you think they are. At some point, for most directs, in fact, a boss who
(a) does not have time for them and (b) says "you're important" is a bit like
all the firms who say, "Our people are our most important asset." as a cynical
joke.

#### I Have Time To Prepare

You may think that your directs get time to talk to you every day, when you stop
by their desk to chat. When you stop by their desk to chat, you do some
chit-chat, and then you discus whatever you stopped by for. Directs know this,
and they don't assume that your stopping by randomly means it is an open forum
to bring up ideas, issues, or concerns.

If you use the excuse, "My schedule is too fluid," in order not to schedule O3s,
to them this means the same (whether you mean it or not) as "I'm not going to
have O3s"

Time with you directs is the most important time that you will spend at work.
"Being busy" isn't a good excuse if you know this.

If you can't fit the O3s in your schedule now, start them 3 or 4 weeks from now
when certainly your schedule will be open. Your calendar is only full because
you're only looking for this week.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/05/time-management)

**If you implement this kind of One On Ones, there's a guarantee that you will
get more time back in your calendar than you spend in having them.**

Having weekly, scheduled and empathic One on Ones will build trust and this
trust will enable you and your directs to do way more with your times.

### Weekly

We usually think about deadlines that are coming up *this week*. You tend to put
oof things that are due next week, even if they will take you several hours of
work. Your directs tend to work the same way, for the most part. They think
about their week when they're thinking about work. Two weeks from now seems like
"the future"

#### Biweekly

> "Meeting with my boos every other week, when everything else is done weekly,
> feels like he's putting me on the 'back burner'".

You will get better results from biweekly O3s than from not having them unlike
with monthly O3s, that hinder performance.

There's a benefit to holding weekly O3s that is lost if you go to biweekly O3s:
*a significant reduction in interruptions.*

A caveat: If you have more than 10 directs, it's okay to start with biweekly
O3s. If you have way bigger teams, you have a organizational structure problem
and not a managerial behavior problem.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2009/08/team-formation-how-big)

Another problem is that if you miss one biweekly One On One, it can become a monthly O3.

#### Monthly

Just DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON'T

### 30-Minute Meeting

There's no benefit going longer than 30 minutes, and people will reschedule more
often if they do.

20 minutes is too short. When it starts late there will be no value and shit
happens.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2009/09/timely-meetings-part-1)

It's best to have a jam-packed meeting of 30 minutes than a relaxed 1 hour
meeting where you only have 40 to 45 minutes of content

### With Each of your Directs

If you're going to do O3s, you've got to do them with *all of your directs*.

One on Ones are not about differentiating among directs but, rather, about
making time for *each* direct, in order to develop a relationship with each one.

You should not hold One on Ones with anyone other than your direct reports.
*This means that you don't do One on Ones with people who report to your
directs.* (A caveat: you can do peer One on Ones with other managers who report
to your boss and with whom you need to maintain a strong relationship or other
stakeholders in the team)

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2011/04/peer-one-ones-part-1)

*Insits on your subordinate managers doing One On Ones with their directs.*
Build an organization of effective managers under you. This is how organizations
stay healthy and effective as they grow.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/04/skip-levels)

### The Manager Takes Notes

Directs have told us in every study we've ever done that their manager taking
notes actually elevates the conversation, making it more important.

In One on Ones in which the manager did no note taking, the directs felt that
the manager didn't care about what was being said from a professional
perspective.

> The problem with a One on One in which the manager does not take notes isn't
> the lack of note taking; it's the lack of accountability that no note taking
> implies

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2011/11/a-notebook-and-a-pen)

What you don't want to use to take notes is your normal "go to meeting"
notebook. This would scatter your O3 notes.

We recommend that you have some distinctive way to capture deliverables. You
should be able to see it quickly. you need to be able to see your
deliverables--your promises--at a glance.

We recommend that you capture feedback, but not in detail or perfectly.

### Where to Conduct One on Ones

Don't do a One On One in public. That's it, really.

## Chapter Five: Common Questions and Resistance to One On Ones

### The Most Common Forms of One-on-One Pushback

First, let's be clear about pushback in general. Don't ever be surprised by it.
Just because you think what you're going to try is a good idea doesn't mean your
directs will go along with it.

*Your directs do not see you as a nice person. They see you as their boss.*

So, the fear your role power engenders creates an initial negative response to
new managerial behaviors.

The three most common forms of pushback against O3s are the following:

1. It's micromanaging;
2. I don't have time;
3. We talk all the time;

### It's Micromanaging

Would you deny YOUR boss the right to see you for 30 minutes once a week? Would
you turn down his request for a meeting? Would you just not go?

Never tolerate from your directs what you would not do to your boss.

From the company's perspective, which is the perspective the manager must take,
a direct who wishes for virtually no managerial oversight is a liability risk.

The direct who believes that a 30-minute meeting once a week is burdensome and
means that you are overbearing is telling you either that he is afraid of
oversight, which is legally scary, or that he is above it, which is a level of
arrogance that could tear apart your team.

Management, reasonably practiced in virtually every organization, provides
necessary guidance, controls, and incetives far below a level that is intrusive
or detrimental.

So what is micromanagement?

> *Micromanagement is the systemic and routine application of an intrusive
> relationship such that the manager assigns a task, explains what to do, how to
> do it, insists on total process compliance, and then observes the work in real
> time, correcting the work as it is being done, and, in the event of divergence
> from standards, taking OVER the work and completing it himself.*

A demanding boss is *not* a micromanager. Asking for reports is *not*
micromanaging. Expecting updates is *not* micromanaging. Asking for one meeting
a week is *not* micromanaging someone. Spending time communicating about tasks,
deliverables, deadlines, successes, failures, growth opportunities, and, yes,
even family--is *not* micromanaging in any way.

So here's what to say if you hear the It's Micromanaging pushback:

> "One on Ones are really pretty far from micromanagement, that to compare them
> is to show that we've got really diffrent ideas about what each of them are,
> and what they mean. Micromanaging is `<definition-of-micromanagement>`. A One
> On One, on the other hand, is a 30-minute meeting held once a week, between
> you and me. That's it. There's a very brief agenda, no reporting is required,
> and you will need only about two to three minutes of preparation time each
> week. I really don't see One On Ones as being anywhere near micromanagement."

One on Ones are not unreasonable, and the reason they're not is that they
basically are a new form of communication that eliminates several other less
efficient and less effective forms of communication.

One on Ones are meetings where you:

- Talk about performance;
- Answer questions;
- Provide feedback;
- Assign work;
- Praise;
- Provide coaching;
- Talk about relationships;
- Discuss development;
- Develop relationships;
- Inquire about the status of assigned tasks;
- Expect status reporting;
- Pay attention to work-family balance;
- Plan;
- Check the work of others and reward.

Would someone argue getting that done at one time more efficiently and more
regularly for the direct is somehow bad, inefficient, or ineffective?

You're only asking for 1 percent of the Direct's time.

Simply insist on having them. Remember, though, when you DO use your role power,
it is alwats ore effective if it rests on a strong foundation of a trusting
relationship. Role power is heightened by stronger relationships with one's
team.

### I Don't Have Time

Sometimes, your direct's agenda will be actually very busy. That's why you don't
start doing one on ones right away (wait 3 weeks).

Being so busy that one can't change has dangerous implications.

**_Before trying to get more of everything done, get the most important things
done first._** Before trying to achieve results through *efficiency*. Work on
the right things first. Then become more efficient at doing those right things,
and you'll have more time for either more right things or some less important
things.

Do the math. If your directs don't have a measly **two days** in an *entire
year* to meet with you to talk about work, their performance, and development,
and any other thing they would like to talk about? Is this really team playing
and collaboration?

### Talking Too Much and Talking Too Little

The primary purpose of the relationships you're building is results. One on Ones
are not chances "to just sit around and talk," "to get to know one another
informally," or "to do a quick catch-up." This kind of exchange does not make
sense in a modern work place.

Our proposed agenda is simple:

1. FIRST 10 minutes for your direct to speak,
2. SECOND 10 minutes for you to speak,
3. THIRD 10 minutes to talk about the future

The most important thing is that they go first. The direct goes first and talks
about *whatever the direct wants to talk about.*

Start each O3, every time, with every direct, no matter what, with the same
first question. It eliminates the need to be creative, it increases the
brainpower you put into listening to the answer rather than the question, and it
simplifies your work.

*Whatever you do, don't ask a question you expect a real or detailed answer to.*

The O3 is a 30-minute meeting. You don't have time for chit-chat; that's why
it's not on the agenda.

Your directs have different joys and pains different issues and successes at
home, and different ways of thinking about their work than you do. If you never
give those differences the opportunity to be voiced, you're not really trying to
create a relationship.

If it's important to my team member, *it's important to me*.

So, don't ask your directs for a list of topics. This will rob time from your
direct to prepare the agenda + you might be tempted to question that person
about one of the topics before the one on one and he/she may not be prepared to
talk about that yet.

Also, it's not a good idea to send a direct a list of topics that you're going
to talk about. Managers who share a list of topics in advance step on the
direct's agenda, reducing the direct's satisfaction with the meeting.

74% of directs say that what they want to spend most of their time talking about
on O3s with their boss is work.

*Stop worrying* about your O3s becoming status updates. From your direct's
perspective, the reason it's a valuable "work" discussion is because it's about
*their* work during their portion of the agenda--not what they do for your work
and your agenda, but their work.

Are One On Ones personal or work related? One On Ones create a forum for both.
Trust your directs to choose to talk about what's important to them.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2010/08/one-ones-work-or-personal)

If there's information that you want to get to all of the team *do not* do it
during the One On Ones. It's simply inefficient. Schedule a *"waterfall
meeting"*. Don't use your O3s to pass down standard information that everyone's
getting.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2007/05/how-to-run-your-staff-meeting-part-1-of-2)

The last 10 minutes of your O3s give you an opportunity, *periodically*, to talk
about the future. You probably will only have time to do so once every 20
sessions, 30 minutes is usually not long enough to cover everything that you and
your directs want to cover. Discussing big-picture or future plans with your
directs two to three times a year is probably about right.

*The 10/10/10 agenda is a template; you are not required to discuss the big
picture or the future every week.*

The last 10 minutes is a *reminder* to cover the future or big picture when you
think the timing is reasonably and you run short. If you don't run short, don't
cover the future. If you run short two weeks in a row, there is no need to cover
the future all over again, unless something fundamental changed in the time
being. When you are done, you are done. Don't submit to agenda fascism.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2012/06/common-one-one-mistakes-chapter-one-agenda-fascism)

The agenda of a meeting always serves the purpose of the meeting, not the other
way around.

Don't punish your directs for not opening up. Do not be rude or demand. Ask for
input, and if the direct has none, move on to your portion of the O3.

If this pattern continues, we recommend that you ask *three times* at the start
of each One On One something like this:

> Manager: Whaddaya got?
>
> Direct: Nothing.
>
> Manager: Well, okay. Understand this is *your* O3, and this is your portion of
> it. This is your 15 minutes. It's for brainstorming, asking for help,
> questions, discussions, sharing--whatever you want to talk about.
>
> Direct: I'm good.
>
> Manager: Okay. I just want to make sure you don't have anything. I have some
> stuff, but you get to go first. Final answer?
>
> Direct: Nope.

Any more would be annoying.

Once you start realizing that there's a problem, we recommend that you start
asking more questions about work status, progress, issues, concerns, and needs.

This level of resistance is rare. Give it time, and your direct will gradually
open up, over time.

### Pushback on Note Taking

Two types:

1. Note taking in the laptop: Notes written with a pen and paper are easier to
   remember + you won't be distracted by email or slack, even if you close those
   apps your directs will still think that they might be open;
2. This is "Documentation": Documentation is an obligation, not something to be
   feared. Documenting is not bad. You don't start documenting only when
   something goes bad.

### Can I do One On Ones over the phone

If you CAN do face-to-face One On Ones, we recommend, of course, that you do so.

When possible, use webcams.

#### The Basics still Apply

- Primary focus on the Team member
- Regularly Scheduled
- Never Missed
- 30 Minutes
- Take Notes

#### It Works Better If We Call Them

If you rely on your directs to call you, you'll end up with less frequent
meetings. They get busy. If you really believe in the relationship value of One
On Ones, you will make the time to call your directs, just like when you are
going to a meeting in a conference room. Don't make your directs come and find
you.

#### More Document Sharing Is Necessary

Distant management requires that you become much more effective at managing
others based on their work product. Effective managers ask for more documents
from their directs in advance of phone One On Ones to give themselves a better
opportunity to assess the quality and quantity of their directs' work product
and to allow time to give them feedback on it.

Asking for key documents in advance speeds up the One on One.

Know where your direct's work product documents are, and have them available to
you both when doing a One On One.

#### Interruptions are more frequent without focus

1. Start with your back turned (don't look at anything else)
2. Ignore Interruptions
3. Focus

### Can I Be Friends with My Directs

The appearance of friendship is a significant detractor to one's ability to lead
and manage others.

This can affect how others interpret your assessment of their performance.

Friendship implies a social obligation to someone else.

A manager cannot expect to be treated as a professional if she at times accepts
the different set of moral obligations that friendship also implies. If you're a
manager, a part of you knows this. It's not a joy to talk about, but we can't
just ignore the friction between our various sets of obligations.

#### Your Directs Don't Think of You as a Friend (first)

Your directs think of you as their boss. Those who don't, we discover, are
terribly difficult to manage. Everyone else should see you as your direct's
boss, not as your direct's friend.

They should assume that, regardless of any previous relationship, your decisions
will be based on managerial factors, not friendship. If they find out otherwise,
you won't be taken seriously for much longer.

#### You can be friendly with your directs

You cannot be friends with your directs, but you can be friendly with them.

To be a friend, as opposed to simply engaging in friendly behavior, one also
accepts the obligation that "being a friend" means.

#### You Cannot Show Favoritism with Your Friendships

- You can't be friends with ANY of your directs
- You CAN behave in a friendly way to ALL of your directs
- You can't behave in a friendly way to some of your directs--even if they're
  not your friends--without behaving similarly with all your directs.

#### You Cannot Do or Say Stupid or Drunk Things with Your Directs

Just don't.

## Chapter Six: How to Start Doing One On Ones

### Choose Times from Your Calendar

Take the number of directs you have, multiply by 1.5 and that's the number of
choices you need to make available to your team in your email.

1. Look at your calendar three to four weeks from now to choose the times. Don't
   look at this week or the next couple--you're probably too busy right now.
2. Avoid times right before and after staff meetings or regular meetings with
   your boss.
3. Don't choose monday morning;
4. Don't choose friday afternoon;
5. Some managers prefer to have all of their O3s on one day (if they don't have
   too many). Some managers prefer to spread them out. Our data are inconclusive
   about which works better--do what works for you.
6. Don't let your directs choose whatever time works best for them: Their
   schedule is less bound than yours
7. Don't choose times that work for you without any input. Directs won't like
   the times you choose for them, even if their calendar is as open as the Texas
   plains.
8. Don't lay out the calendars and try to find the best times for you and for
   them.

### Send Out a One-On-One Email Invitation

Give your directs 48 hours to respond with their chosen time. Tell them to reply
to all when they do so that everyone know which time slots have teen taken.

### Allow for Possible Changes In the Near Future

Planning is everything; plans are nothing. Things are going to change.

### Review Intent, Ground Rules, and O3 Agenda in Your Staff Meeting

Walk them through the purpose and what you've learned.

### Answer Questions

Stand up in front of your directs and take questions from them. Don't be afraid
of saying, "I don't know. We'll figure out as we go."

### Do only this for the next 12 weeks

Don't add more processes

## Chapter Seven: Talk about Performance--Feedback

Feedback isn't inherently difficult to give, or to receive. It's a great deal
easier to give and receive feedback when trust has been built. When you do it
wrong, however, it feels *really* wrong to the direct. But doing it right just
isn't all that difficult.

Yes, communicating about your directs' performance is part of your job, and yes,
it's unlikely you've been doing it at a very high level, but you can be forgiven
for not having done it much or done it well. Why? Because you've never been
taught how.

The average manager hasn't been trained, tutored, mentored, taught, or coached
with anything approaching professional development of the skills necessary for
becoming a successful manager.

![A graph showing time and the positive/negative things a direct did](/images/the-effective-manager/the-basics-of-feedback.jpg "You want the new behavior to be positive")

When the average manager gives feedback, *the focus is on what happened.*. The
manager can do nothing about things in the past.

*Directs get defensive because managers talk to them about their mistakes--which
happened in the past--about which the directs can do nothing. So, they feel
trapped.*

Ask yourself:

1. *Did I make any mistakes the last month?*
2. *Did I intend to make those mistakes? Did I set out to mess things up on
   purpose?*

Remember, our directs are similar to us. They made mistakes, but they weren't
actively trying to mess things up. They *had good reasons for the mistakes they
made!*

There are all kinds of reasons why directs defend themselves. Probably first on
the list is a lack of trust in you, their boss.

The lack of frequent performance communications increases directs' defensiveness
as well. If you don't point out mistakes frequently, your directs assume that,
when you do choose to talk to them, they *may* be "in trouble". Their
defensiveness, then, should not be surprising.

*The purpose of performance communications (and therefore feedback) is to
_encourage effective future behavior_*.

### Encourage Effective Future Behavior

The moment you switch to a future focus, you free yourself up to focus on
something that you (and they) can do something about.

**_Regardless of whether your direct was ineffective or effective this morning,
the true purpose of any performance communication about either situation is
exactly the same: you want more effective behavior in the future._**

Focus on what you want, and don't worry about exactly how you're going to word
some criticism or about how to praise someone.

The Manager Tools Feedback Model has four simple steps:

1. Ask;
2. State the Behavior;
3. State the Impact of the Behavior;
4. Encourage Effective Future Behavior.

#### Step 1: Ask

> "Can I give you some feedback?"
> "Can I make an observation?"
> "Can I share something with you?"
> "Can I have a word with you?"

The reason you should ask for permission is that the only person who can engage
in the behavior is the team member to whom you're talking.

The direct needs to be able to listen and hear you in order for you to be sure
that the direct will be at least able to understand what future behaviors you
want him to engage in.

**It's an important managerial rule to never ask a question of your directs if
you don't intend to honor their answer**. Do not go ahead if they say they
cannot listen now.

*Asking directs for permission to give them feedback significantly increases
their appreciation for your giving them the feedback and also the likelihood of
their effective future behavior.*

> Do you want to be the boss, or do you want your team to be more effective?

Being a little bit scripted and maybe even awkward--for a short time--in the
service of giving your directs what you know they want is a reasonable price to
pay for more effectiveness.

#### Step 2: State the Behavior

> "When you (insert behavior) . . ."

Behavior consists of five things as we define it:

1. **The Words You Say.** Our choice of words make a difference in business
   results. Even if the intent is the same, the words matter if they're likely
   to influence the outcome;
2. **How You Say Those Words.** The tone and tenor of your words and the speed
   an inflection with which you say them can change your meaning;
3. **Your Facial Expressions.** Meaning is determined 7 percent based on the
   words we use, 38 percent by tonal differences, and 55 percent by nonverbal
   cues;
4. **Body Language.**
5. **Work Product.** What you do and how well you do your job are behaviors as
   well. As a general rule, work product behavior is defined more specifically
   as:
   1. *Quality*
   2. *Quantity*
   3. *Accuracy*
   4. *Timeliness*
   5. *Documents*

You'll notice that neither attitude nor motivation are parts of behavior. We're
bad at guessing what others' intent is, and our directs know they can argue
about what's in their head, because we can't prove that was "actually" their
intent.

It's true that attitudes and motivations drive behaviors, but they're not
visible, and we can only guess at them. Therefore, we DON'T give feedback on
what directs meant, or why they did something, or what their attitude was when
they did something.

> "When you are ahead of schedule . . . "
> "When you stay an extra hour to find the root cause . . ."
> "When you respond politely after the customer insuls you . . ."
> "When you make that extra call to keep the customer informed . . ."
> "When you promise it to me yesterday but don't deliver . . ."

Directs don't want managers to sugarcoat negative feedback. They don't want them
to work their way toward saying something/ They don't want chit-chat. More words
*do not soften the blow.* They want managers to say what needs to be said. Be
brief. Say *When you.*

#### Step 3: State the Impact of the Behavior

Effective feedback isn't about waiting until there's a pattern, and it doesn't
get better with age. Wouldn't you rather know sooner rather than later that
there's a problem?

Look for small impacts that happen every day. It's easier to give feedback on
them, and all those small changes will add up.

> "I can focus on other areas that need my attention."
> "Here's what happens: the customer calls to thank me"
> "Here's what happens: I notice your extra effort"
> "I appreciate it, and the team's job is much easier."
> "Our case for the new hire is that much stronger."
> "The project stays green, and we dodge a political bullet."

#### Step 4: Encourage Effective Future Behavior

We either ask for a change in behavior or say thank you for behavior that we
want to encourage.

With affirming/positive feedback, the direct now has a specific understanding of
the behavior that was effective and the impact it has.

When it's positive:

> "Thanks."
> "Please keep it up."

Some examples when it's negative:

> "Could you change that?"
> "Can you do that differently?"
> "What can you do differently?"
> "How could that be better?"

---

Again, the four steps:

1. Step 1: Ask.
2. Step 2: State the Behavior.
3. Step 3: State the impact of the Behavior.
4. Step 4: Encourage Effective Future Behavior.

### When Should I Give Feedback?

Giving immediate feedback is ideal.

We take feedback for granted in virtually every aspect of our lives. We also
take for granted that we're going to get it fairly quickly.

Whenever possible, it's best for managers to give feedback immediately after
they see, hear, or notice the behavior.

The sooner your directs get feedback about what they do, good or bad, the more
quickly they can implement that feedback. If managers can give feedback
immediately, it works better.

It is hard to achieve immediate feedback. Go for *feedback as soon as is
practicable.*

When you *can* give immediate feedback, do so, and relish the moment. Your
direct will, too. Give yourself credit for the equivalent of *two* feedback
moments when your feedback is immediate.

If you can't give feedback immediately, this doesn't mean that you can't give
it; it just means it won't be immediate.

#### The Simple Answer Is, The Sooner Is Better

The real goal for timing your feedback is as soon as you can.

Never give feedback that's more than a week old. Your ability to remember
precisely by then has faded enough so that you may not get it right, and
accuracy matters when you are giving feedback.

If what you noticed or heard about happened *before your last One On One*, as a
general rule, **don't** give feedback about it.

## Chapter Eight: Common Questions and Resistance to Feedback

While it may feel good to vent, in the long run, it's ineffective. It's really
bad when the anger is what's driving my desire, not *my direct's effective
future behavior.*

Giving feedback in theory is almost always different from giving feedback in
practice.

Never violate the purpose of the feedback: to encourage effective future
behavior.

### Question 1: Am I Angry?

If you're angry, don't give feedback. Period.

If your directs know you're angry, then the feedback is about you and not about
them, and that violates the purpose of the feedback.

### Question 2: Do I Want to Remind or Punish?

If you're giving feedback, then your purpose is to encourage effective future
behavior. You have to mention the past, but that's not your purpose. You're not
trying to point out the mistake.

### Question 3: Can I Let It Go?

If you can't let it go in terms of how you feel, we recommend that you *do* let
it go by not giving the negative feedback. Managers who feel an urge to deliver
feedback are doing it for the wrong reasons.

We shouldn't confuse the need for delivering feedback quickly with an emotional
*urge* to do so.

The manager who really believes in the purpose of feedback and wants to focus on
encouraging effective future behavior isn't in a negative emotional rush to give
feedback.

You should be able to pause.

### Maybe Delay or Defer

If you don't pass the 3 questions: either delay or defer.

Remember that feedback is about the future.

### What Do I Do If One of My Directs Pushes Back or Refuses Feedback?

Many newer managers are stunned into a kind of muteness when their direct pushes
back or refuses feedback. The answer is *The Shot across the Bow.*

1. To shoot across the bow, the enemy ship must be within range;
2. When you shoot there, you can prove that you can hit what you are aiming at.

Basically, a short across the bow says, "I can reach you, and I can hit you if I
want to."

*When your direct gets defensive you needn't do anything at all about it,
because you have already fired a shot across their bow.*

Feedback is about encouraging effective future behavior. If your direct becomes
defensive, he is being defensive about what happened, or why it has happened, or
that it didn't happen. These are all arguments *about the past*.

*We recommend that you give in when a direct argues or gets defensive.* Do NOT
get drawn out in a discussion about the past.

It doesn't matter what he/she says. What matters is if they change their future
behavior.

### The Capstone: Systemic Feedback

What do you do when you've tried giving negative feedback but it doesn't seem to
be working?

91 percent of directs, when given negative feedback in our format, change their
behavior after one instance.

Before we talk about what to do there is a distinction to make:

1. Different behaviors
2. Similar behaviors

If the direct is making mistakes in several different areas of behavior, give
them feedback in those different areas. Several instances of one mistake in
different areas of behavior isn't a problem.

Repeated behaviors without a change toward effectiveness are responded to by
*Systemic Feedback.* It addresses the greater failure to meet a repeated
commitment. Failure to meet commitments is a systemic failure that no
organization can long tolerate among its members.

You should help, get your direct training, find him a mentor, assist him
yourself--but those things are separate from your responsibility to give him
feedback.

When giving feedback week to week, *we don't change the done, or delivery in any
way.* We don't escalate, or use a tone that suggests that "things are getting
worse". We don't hint at consequences.

Keep giving him feedback about his weekly failure for six weeks without much
difference. Offer help, but we're still obligated to give him feedback.

In the sixth week talk about his lack of commitment.

> "When you tell me week after week that you're going to improve your quality
> numbers and then you don't, my concern is no longer jsut about the quality of
> your work. It's about you making repeated commitments--to me--that you're
> failing to keep. In my mind this is much more serious than missing your
> quality standard. Your word of commitment will follow you your entire career.
> What can you do differently about this more serious problem?"

Systemic feedback addresses the moral hazard of a direct commiting to a new
behavior but then failing to follow through. *We can tolerate directs who make
mistakes. We __cannot__ tolerate directs who repeatedly make commitments they
don't keep.*

### When Do We Use It?

Six instances of standard feedback in a period of time that indicates a pattern.

This is not the final step of feedback. You use systemic feedback before you
think about considering organizational sanctions, like a performance improvement
plan.

### How Is It Different?

The behavior about which we're giving feedback is the failure to meet
commitments.

Standard feedback is delivered lightly and professionally, without engaging in
shows of power, anger, or fear, whreas systemic feedback is more serious. It is
not appropriate to deliver systemic feedback in a casual way.

### Two Dangers

1. We must be Faithful to the Feedback Model's Step 4: We have to have repeated
   commitments from our direct;
2. Implied Sanctions Must be delivered: If we promise sanctions, we must deliver
   them when and how we say they are going to be delivered if the behavior is
   not forth coming

Systematic feedback is an exceptionally effective way to get the direct's
attention and to motivate the change of a direct who has resisted change up to
that point.

## Chapter Nine: How to Start Delivering Feedback

### Announce Your Intention in Your Weekly Staff Meeting

We don't recommend giving the same briefing over and over again in your One On
Ones--that's inefficient.

### Schedule 30 Minutes for your Briefing

It's better not to rush

### Use Our Materials

Free feedback document on manager tools website

### Cover the Purpose of Feedback

Talk to your directs about the purpose of giving feedback, which is to
"encourage future behavior." The fear that your firects will feel about feedback
will cause them to attribute to you motives that you are unlikely to have in
your heart.

### Walk Them through Each Step of the Feedback Model

"I've got an obligation to help you be at your very best every day."

Tell your directs that negative feedback isn't about punishment; it's about
doing things better. it is about the future.

### Give Only Positive Feedback for Eight Weeks

Don't give any negative feedback as you're learning to use the feedback model.

Shoot for one item of feedback to one direct per day as you start. If you can go
five days in a row having given feedback one time, raise your limit to two, and
so on.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2012/01/measuring-feedback-chapter-1-part-1)

### Add in Negative Feedback after Eight Weeks

We don't switch from positive to negative feedback.

You don't want to be awkward or clumsy if there's a chance it will make the
moment less useful or more stressful with your directs.

### Stay as Positive as You Can

Great managers will tell you that they give out far more positive than negative
performance communications.

Positive feedback is a much more powerful tool than negative feedback. Don't
wait your entire career to finalize realize that.

## Chapter Ten: Ask for more--Coaching

We're obligated as managers to get the most out of our directs as we can. if a
direct is capable of more/better/higher performance, the manager is obligated to
work hard to make it happen.

**_Manager Tools defines coaching as a systemic effort to improve the
performance of a direct in a specific skill area._** It's neither episodic nor
inherently negative.

Our Coaching Model has four simple steps:

1. Collaborate to Set a Goal;
2. Collaborate to Brainstorm Resources;
3. Collaborate to Create a Plan;
4. The Direct Acts and Reports on the Plan;

### Collaborate to Set a Goal

Coaching is most effective when it is collaborative. Managers know where the
most likely opportunities are, but the direct is the one who will be learning
and growing, and the manager can't do that for the direct any more than the
direct can always be right picking the topic or knowing the resources.

How to set a goal? Describe a behavior or a result that we want to achieve by a
date when we want it achieved. Here are some examples:

- By 1 December, you will attain Certified Network Engineer (CNE) status.
- By 30 October, you will run the staff meeting succesfully.
- By 1 January, you will submit the Capital Plan without errors.

DBQ: Deadline + Behavior + Quality.

We usually don't set deadlines of less than four months. If someone can change
their behavior in less than four months, the person probably just needs a lot of
feedback and we don't need a coaching plan.

The Behavior portion is what we want the Direct to master--the behavior we want
to improve.

The Quality portion is how we're going to measure the behavior. *What the
measure of success is* for the behavior we're expecting to change.

We recommend you write down the coaching engagement goal on your One-On-One
forms.

### Collaborate to Brainstorm Resources

*You don't have to know how to get someone from start to finish to do a
Behavior. You only have to know how to start them to learn how to do it.*

This is a hard concept for most managers to grasp. We all seem to want silver
bullets--quick and easy, one-shot, no-brainer solutions. Stop looking for those.
Start thinking about things that MIGHT work. When they do, celebrate the
progress toward the goal. When they don't, consider it a lesson learned. We're
not delivering a product here against a strict delivery deadline. We're helping
someone improve.

Sit down with your direct and brainstorm. Go for volume, not accuracy. We're not
looking for the one right thing.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/07/brainstorming-part-1-of-2)

### Collaborate to Create a Plan

The steps in the plan each have three parts: A deadline, a behavior, and the
reporting that the task is done which is inherent in the task. The reporting is
what makes the task *deliverable*.

Some examples:

- By 15 July, email me a receipt for your order of the book *The Effective
  Executive* from Amazon;
- By 7 May, send me an email on what you have learned listening to Manager Tools
  Podcast on Pre-Wire.
- By 19 March, send me an email with names of three potential mentors

We recommend that you start with lower cost things.

We're only going to plan the first one to two weeks. We are not going to plan
the entire six months of work. Thing change too much between now and then. We'll
never coach anyone with that model of full planning.

I want you to learn to think differently about task creation and assignment. If
you assign additional work, and give it a long deadline, it's unlikely to get
done. Even when development is *necessary*, the vast majority of directs
struggle with long deadlines. *It doesn't make sense to do this if we know it
doesn't work*.

If we assign tasks of a as long as a week and we check each week, urgent daily
activities regularly take precedence, leading to coaching "projects" being
behind by a week immediately, and then additional weeks as each new week passes.

You know urgency is a key driver of organizational behavior. Deadlines that
**are going to be enforced** but that are believed to be reasonable and reachable
area a big facilitator of coaching success.

Se short deadlines, on do-able tasks, to increase the chance of completion.

Some examples:

- By 3 PM today, Monday, send me a list of five books on Amazon that deal with
  communications, habits, or interrupting that you think might be helpful
- By 11 AM Tuesday morning, email me a receipt for the book you ordered.
- By noon Thursday, email me a picture of the book on your desk.
- By 3 PM Friday, send me a three sentence overview of Chapter 1 of the book you
  bought.

Tight tasks down to a hourly scope. We will also make our direct feel like he's
getting somewhere: he has completed several deliverables, all on time. He starts
the next O3 saying he accomplished all the 5 tasks you gave him.

Notice that the tasks are not done until they are reported on as "being done".
That's the difference between assigning a task and assigning a deliverable.

We don't assign reading a chapter of a book, for instance. We assign the task of
reporting (to the boss) that reading.

We learn by doing. Whenever possible, we look for opportunities to observe our
direct engaging in the behavior we want, to provide the direct with feedback on
what we observe, and we make that a regular, very short-scope task.

All the classes in the world, all the books, all the mentors--none of that
matters if the behavior doesn't change.

Assigning behaviors that enable the manager to view the behavior being coached
might look like this:

- Achieve two or fewer interruptions in your interactions with me, in all of our
  interactions this week.
- Achieve one or zero interruption in your interactions with me, in all of our
  interactions this week.
- Achieve no interruptions in your interactions with me, in all of our
  interactions this week.

### The Direct Acts and Reports on the Plan

Once we collaborate on resources, we collaborate on some very short-scope
tasks, and then the direct gets to work.

The way the process is set up, we're getting daily or at least regular updates
in the form of task completion e-mails, and we are briefly discussing the
direct's progress each week during our One-On-One. We expect the direct to brief
us during the One On One on his or her progress for the week. As a general rule,
we wait until the ned of the O3. We don't spend the direct's time with an agenda
of updates.

Every week, in every One On One, we're reviewing completed tasks, rescheduling
uncompleted tasks, and creating new deliverables based on where we are in the
process.

What do you do if the direct doesn't accomplish all of the tasks? What do we do
when the direct runs out of tasks?

#### When they fail to Accomplish Something the Previous Week

If the direct fails to accomplish something the previous week, we give the
direct negative feedback.

Example:

> Manager: "Derek can I give you some feedback?"
> Derek: "Sure."
> Manager: "When you miss your coaching deadlines, that's more work for later. Can you change that?"
> Derek: "Sure I'll do better"

Other example:

> Manager: "Derek can I give you some feedback?"
> Derek: "Sure."
> Manager: "When you don't let me know the task is done, I don't get a sense of how you're doing."
> Derek: "Thanks, boss"

Conversely, give positive feedback for the deliverables he did achieve. See if
you can work out how one of those might sound.

#### When They Run Out of Tasks

Very short-scope planning means you're back to planning the next week or two
very quickly.

When the direct runs out of tasks, we just sit down in the next O3 and either
extend the resource the direct is already using (more mentor meetings, more book
chapters to read, more meetings to attend during which interruptions are
counted, more positive feedback goals on not interrupting) or go back to the our
resource list to see if there's something there we could use to help the direct
move toward the goal.

When a particular resource doesn't seem to work, we stop using it. This is
particularly important to remember when we and our direct are different in style
or behavioral tendency.

## Chapter Eleven: How to Start Coaching

Set aside time in your weekly staff meeting, and walk through the four-step
Coaching Model. If you have time, give your directs examples of Deadline,
Behavior, Quality (DBQ) goals and how effective tasks are actually deliverables
with short deadlines.

Start by coaching one or two top performers. It's not a good idea to try to
start coaching everyone all at once. Even though it doesn't take as much time as
One On Ones, coaching feels more intensive to many managers. It will be more fun
to coach a top performer because you probably won't feel that it's a "must
improve" situation the way you will feel as you start to coach some of your
at-risk performers.

After coaching a couple of your top performers through one or two successful
coaching sessions, roll out coaching more broadly across your entire team.

## Chapter Twelve: Push Work Down--Delegation

When you're a software development manager your job changes from solving
technical problems to making others more effective so they can solve these
problems. Your job changes from one about technology to one about people.

When you're promoted, your job changes again--from leveraging others' technical
skills to leveraging others' people skills.

You individually are able to do more because you were trusted with more to do
along the way. You benefited enormously from your bosses giving you more to do.

Too many managers today think that because they're are smarter and more
effective at getting things done than their directs, they should try to get more
done by doing it themselves. This isn't sustainable, and I've seen the failure
scenario play out a hundred times.

You need to learn to trust your folks and delegate as a manager if you ever want
to become an executive.

If you're a manager, your key to long-term success is to master the art of
delegation.

What delegation is and isn't:

Just because your work passes between you and your direct doesn't make it
delegation. That is task assignment. You're not delegating a task when it's not
a task you would normally do, and you're simply assigning that task among
members of your team. This is simple task assignment.

Delegation, on the other hand, is you turning over responsibility for one of
your regular responsibilities--something you routinely do--on a permanent or
long standing basis, to one of your directs.

Task assignment is different from delegations.

[üéß There's a cast for thatüëÜüèæ](https://www.manager-tools.com/2011/02/how-assign-work-tasks-part-1)

### Why Delegation Is the Solution--The Delegation Cascade

Your time is limited. You can only fill it up until a point. When your box is
full, you cannot fill anything new with either increasing that box or removing
one of those balls.

![A box with differently sized balls that show a persons work life](/images/the-effective-manager/work-life-diagram-20.jpg "Choose what you want to fill your work life by effectiveness and push down the rest")
*Choose what you want to fill your work life by effectiveness and push down the rest*

You might think that you could get more out of your week if you could fill up
some of those empty spaces between the balls with work. But that's not really
possible. *There's no way you're ever going to be 100 percent efficient.* The
in-between spaces represent your inefficiencies.

But suddenly you receive something more important to do, how to you fit it in
your box? You immediately realize this is going to take you a bunch of time to
get done--it's not just any ball, it's a big ball.

![A box with differently sized balls that show a persons work life. There is one new extra ball that does not fit in the box](/images/the-effective-manager/work-life-diagram-21.jpg "How will you fit a new responsbility when your work life is full?")
*How will you fit a new responsibility when your work life is full?*

You can work more hours. The size of the box is the absolute maximum your body
and your family allows you to work. You could work more for a short period, but
if this is a long lasting responbility, you cannot solve it that way.

You can't work "smarter." Over time, we all get smarter about our work and we
all can do more, but that isn't the solution in this case. You can't get
instantly smart enough to deal with this new responsibility.

And finally, you can't say no. You've told your boss you want more
responsibility it wouldn't be smart for you to turn down what you've been asking
for.

The solution, of course, is *delegation*.

We have three choices:

* Delegate the big black ball
* Delegate one of the big gray balls
* Delegate on or more of the small gray balls.

#### Delegating the Big Black Ball

Delegating your new responsibility, is *an extremely bad idea.* Why? In part
because *you don't know how to do it yet.* If you don't know how to do it, how
are you going to help your direct to whom you delegate it learn how to do it?

You need to understand the work (remember, you have never done it before) before
you can delegate it.

*Don't ever delegate a new responsibility your boss has just given you to one of
your directs. Lear it first, master it, before you consider delegating it.*

#### Delegate One of the Big Gray Balls

**_One of your small balls is already a big ball to your direct._**

The direct doesn't know how to do the task, and the expectations are higher.
It's tough. They have to spend more time to get it done. And because it's
something you used to do, by definition it's going to be as important as any of
the big balls they're already working/spending time on.

Why shouldn't you delegate one of your big balls to your direct? Because it
would be bigger, and it could crush him.

If you thought of splitting a big ball among multiple directs, that's generally
not a good plan, either. If it were easy to split the ball, the ball probably
would have already been split up into smaller balls. Plus you'll end up spending
more time coordinating all the work that you split up.

#### Delegate One or More of the Small Balls

The best solution is to delegate multiple small balls to multiple different
directs. And now you are part of an important organizational behavior pattern
that helps good organizations become great.

The CEO delegates some of his responsibilities to the COO, the COO delegates one
of his responsibilities to your VP. The VP delegates one of her responsibilities
to you. This rolls down the organization. And it's called the Delegation
Cascade.

*The individual contributor stops doing something* (or, more specifically, and
to stay with the math, five small things). We call this delegating to the floor.

If we're going to protect everything that individual contributor does, we're
going to force the company to stop taking on new customers, new revenue, new
opportunities in the marketplace. All because "everybody is busy." Surely not.

There's more to the decision that individual contributor has to make about what
they might "delegate to the floor"

### How to Delegate--The Manager Tools Delegation Model
Delegating has five steps:

1. State your desire for help;
2. Tell them why you're asking *them*;
3. Ask for specific acceptance;
4. Describe the task or project in detail;
5. Address deadline, quality, and reporting standards.


#### 1. State Your Desire For Help

The best delegations allow the direct to say no. Do not use the word *need*.

- "Sarah, I'd like your help"
- "Brian, can you do me a favor?"

We ask nicely, but don't get too personal

#### 2. Tell Them Why You're Asking *Them*

Help her understand your rationale for choosing her.

How can you know which of your directs is right for this responsibility? There's
a simple guideline you can apply that will help (Assuming you spent time getting
to know your directs.)

Look for areas of your directs' abilities to determine what to delegate to whom:
what they're *good* at, what they *like* to do, what they *need* to do, or what
they *want* to do. AS a general rule, disregard what *you* are good at, or what
you *like* to do. This isn't about you. In delegating your lesser
responsibilities, you ought not to bethinking about yourself.

> *Don't think about you, and about what you want to get rid of. Think about
> them, and what they could benefit from.*

1. **What they're good at**: Play to their strenghts
2. **What they like to do**: When you love something, it tells you all its secrets.
3. **What they need to do**: Areas of improvement
4. **what they want to do**: If they have a desire for an area, delegate.

#### 3. Ask for Specific Acceptance

Ask them to accept the ownership BEFORE giving the details of what's involved. A
direct who has already agreed is much more likely to listen to the details *with
an attitude of ownership and trying to solve the problem.*

There's another reason to ask first before providing the details. If the person
doesn't say yes immediately, she's likely to say something like: "Well, I could,
but I'm worried about my workload."

If an objection happens, solve the concerns: "If I can address your concerns,
will you agree?", "If I can sort out your workload, will you be able to do this
work?" or "If I can teach you how, will you do it?"

#### 4. Describe the Task or Project in Detail

It typically starts with "**Here's what I do**". Because this is something you
yourself are doing now, you're an expert on how it's done.

#### 5. Address Deadline, Quality, and Reporting Standards

> "You'll report on the 15th of each month, and here's the template. This is
> work that is seen by the VP, so it needs to be perfect. I want weekly updates,
> in our O3, with Red/Amber/Green status standards."

## Chapter Thirteen: Common Questions and Resistance to Delegation

### What should you delegate?

1. *Reporting*
2. *Meetings*
3. *Presentations*
4. *Projects*

### What If a Direct Repeatedly Says No to Delegation Requests?

This is the danger of a model that is built on relationship power and persuasion
rather than on role power and giving orders. Your directs can say no.

The risk of being told no, however, is worth it. When you use your role power to
get something done, you get what is known as "compliance energy" from your
directs. They know they "have to." They'll do it, but they won't be excited
about it.

When you use your persuasion built on trust from your relationship power to get
something done, you get what is known as "commitment energy." The direct knows
they can say no, *and they choose to say yes. That ability to choose frees up
that last full measure of work devotion that we want form them.*

#### When They Say No, Honor It, Initially

Never ask a question whose answer you don't intend to honor. If you ask one of
your directs a question, you're implying that the directs answer has merit.

The trumping of honest answers leads to dishonesty. Period.

So if a direct says no, it usually means two things, tactically:

1. Either you will ask another direct, which works far better than most managers expect, or
2. You will do the work yourself

Strategically, of course, it also suggests that you look at your efforts toward
building trusting relationships and asking yourself, "Did I not see something,
or was I unaware of what her situation was?"

The overwhelming majority of nos are based on workload issues. Most of us are surprisingly flexible when it comes to taking on more work. We can take on more than we think. *Eustress* sometimes has to become *distress* to know where the dividing line is.

#### After Two Demurrals, Examine Your Assumptions

Probe. Try to overcome (even on the first time). If the answer is still no, step
back before you ask anyone else. Ask yourself: "What do I think his workload is? Is it close to being overwhelming? Is this no a part of a weakening of our relationship that has larger implications?"

Look for the past few weeks for changes in your relationship:

- Behavior changes
- Change of tone in conversations
- Fewer emails
- Change of tone in emails
- Changes in schedule
- Changes in mood
- Changes in attendance
- Changes in meeting behaviors and interactions

After two demurrals, take time in your next One On One to ask questions to the
direct. Be ready for a five-minute conversation, but never ask these questions
right after the direct says no. Give you and your direct some time and space to
reflect.

## Chapter Fourteen: How to Start Delegating

Delegation is the easiest part of the "Management Trinity" to roll out. You can
start right away.

**Build the relationships first** so that people feel comfortable saying no, but
you can move somewhat quickly.

Rolling out feedback and coaching before is a good idea also!

If you want to build the capabilities of your team, you don't need to send them
to a lot of training sessions. Just ask them to step up by pushing some work
down. Your best team members will relish the challenge.
