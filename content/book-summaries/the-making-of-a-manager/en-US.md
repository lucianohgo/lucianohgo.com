**Book Author: _Julie Zhuo_**

## Chapter One: What is management

**Manager's job (before knowing what it is)**:

- Have meetings with directs to help solve problems
- Give feedback
- Promote people

**Manager's job (after having done it for 3 years)**:

- Build a team that works well together
- Support directs achieve their career goals
- Create processes

Both aren't quite right. These items activities, not definitions of the goal and
why the job exists.

### The one-line definition of a manager

The management aspect has nothing to do with employment status and everything to
do with the fact that *you are no longer trying get things done by yourself*

The crux of management: **A team of people can achieve more than a single person
going at it alone.**

Your job as a manager:

> **Get better outcomes from a group of people working together**.

### How to tell a Great manager from an average manager

If the job of a manager is defined by getting better outcomes from a group of
people working together, then a great manager's team will consistently achieve
great outcomes.

You can be the smartest, most well-liked, hardest working manager of all time,
but if your team has a long-standing reputation for mediocre results, then
unfortunately you can't objectively be considered a "great" manager.

The best employees don't tend to stick around for years and years under a boss
who treats them poorly or whom they don't respect. And talented managers can
typically turn a poor performing team around if they are empowered to make
changes;

How facebook CPO evaluates a design manager's job: "Half of what he looked at
was the team's result - did we achieve our aspirations of creating in creating
valuable, easy-to-use and well-crafted design work? The other half was based on
the strength and satisfaction of my team - did I do a good job hiring and
developing individuals and was my team happy and working well together?"

Being awesome at the job means playing the long game and building a reputation
for excellence.

Never forget what you are actually here to do: *help your team get greater
outcomes*.

### The three things managers think about all day

> Problems with coordination and motivation typically chip away at the benefits
> of collaboration

Five conditions that increases a team's chance of success:

1. Having a real team: *Clear boundaries and stable membership*
2. Compelling direction
3. Enabling structure
4. Supportive organizational context
5. Expert coaching

Julie's frame: *Purpose, people and process*

> **Process, People and Purpose**

#### Purpose

The outcome your team is trying to accomplish, otherwise know as the _why_.

> Everyone on the team should have a similar picture of *why does our work
> matter*

The first big part of your job as a manager is to ensure that *your team knows
what success looks like and cares about achieving it*

#### People

Are the members of your team set up to succeed? Do they have the right skills?
Are they motivated to get to work?

To manage people well, you must:

1. develop trusting relationships with them;
2. understand their strengths and weaknesses;
3. make good decisions about who should do what and
4. coach individuals to do their best

#### Process

Describes *how* your team works together. Who should do what *by when*? What
principles should govern decision-making?

> In a team setting, it's impossible for a group of people to coordinate what
> needs to get done without spending time on it. The larger the team, the more
> time is needed.

We need to establish shared values within our team for how we make decisions and
respond to problems.

Important processes for the manager to master:

1. Running effective meetings;
2. Future-proofing against past mistakes;
3. Planning for tomorrow and
4. Nurturing a healthy culture

> *Purpose, people, process*. The why, the who and the how. A great manager
> constantly asks herself how she can influence these levers to improve her
> team's outcomes. As the team grows in size it matters less and less how good
> she is personally at doing the work herself. What matters more is how much of
> a multiplier effect she has on her team

If I spend all my time personally doing the work, then I'm contributing an
additive amount to my business, not a multiplicative one. My performance as a
manager should be considered poor.

Your role as a manager is not tod do the work yourself, even if you are the best
at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the
purpose, people and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on
your collective outcome as you can.

### The difference between leadership and management

*Manager* is a specific role. *Leadership*, on the other hand, is the particular
skill of being able to guide and influence other people. A manager who doesn't
know how to influence others isn't going to be particularly effective at
improving the outcomes of her team. So to be a great manager, one must certainly
be a leader.

Leadership is a quality rather than a job. We are all leaders and followers at
different points in our lives.

> In your early days as a manager, what matters most is transitioning gracefully
> into the role and nailing the essentials of leading a small team. **Only when
> you have built trust with your reports will you have the credibility to help
> them achieve more together**

## Chapter two: Your first three months

Management paths:

1. Apprentice: Your manager's team is growing, so you've been asked to manage a
   part of it going forward;
2. Pioneer: You are a founding member of a new group; you're now responsible for
   its growth;
3. New Boss: You're coming in to manage an already established team either
   within your existing organization or at a new one;
4. Successor: Your manager has decided to leave, and you are taking his place.

### Apprentice

#### What to take advantage of when being the apprentice

> This is usually the easiest way to transition into being a manager

Questions to discuss with your manager before:

- What will be my scope to start, and how do you expect it to change over time?
- How will my transition be communicated?
- What do I need to know about the people that I'll be managing?
- What important team goals or processes should I be away of and help push
  forward?
- What does success look like in my first three and six months?
- How can the two of us stay aligned on who does what?

> You have a sense of what works and what doesn't

A useful exercise to go through at the beginning of your transition is to sit
down and make a list of all the things that are awesome about the current state
of the world.

Now, next to that, create a list of all the things that could be better.

Taking the time to reflect on the biggest opportunities for improvement helps
you understand how to best act as a multiplier for your team.

> You're able to ramp up quickly because you have context

#### What to Watch Out For when being the apprentice

> It can feel awkward to establish a new dynamic with former peers

What can be challenging:

**1. Playing the role of the coach:** Don't avoid these conversations, even if
they feel awkward. Give them feedback about what they're doing well and where
they might stretch; **2. Having hard conversations:** You are now responsible
for the outcome of your team, including all the decisions that are made within
it. If something is getting in the way of great work happening, you need to
address it swiftly and directly. **3. Having people treat you differently or
share less information with you**

> It's tricky to balance your individual contributor commitments with management

At the point in which your team becomes four or five people, you should have a
plan for how to scale back your individual contributor responsibilities so that
you can be the best manager for your people.

### The Pioneer

#### What to take advantage of when being the pioneer

> You've done the done, so you know what it takes

Questions to ask yourself in preparation:

- How do I make decisions?
- What do I consider a job well done?
- What are all the responsibilities I took care of when it was just me?
- What's easy or hard about working in this function?
- What new processes are needed now that this team is growing?

> You get to build the team you want

Ask yourself:

- What qualities do I want in a team member
- What skills does our team need to complement my own
- How should this team look and function in a year
- How will my own role and responsibilities evolve

#### What to watch out for when being the pioneer

- You may not have much support
- It's tricky to balance your IC work with management

### The new boss

#### What to take advantage of when being the new boss

> People cut you slack in the beginning

You are not expected to know anything at first, from what everyone works on to
what the current strategy is. Mistakes you make will be brushed aside, and
you'll find that your colleagues are usually quite willing to bring you up to
speed.

**Use the newbie card to ask as many questions of as many people as you can.**
If your goal is to ramp up quickly, you need to be proactive in your onboarding.

Schedule one-on-ones with the people you will work closely with and make sure
you understand what they care about.

> You start with a blank slate

You have a chance to form new ties and reset your identity.

Ask your reports the following questions to understand what their "dream
manager" looks like:

- What did you and your past manager discuss that was most helpful to you?
- What are the ways in which you'd like to be supported?
- How do you like to be recognized for great work?
- What kind of feedback is most useful for you?
- Imagine that you and I had an amazing relationship. What would that look like?

#### What to watch out for when being the new boss

> It takes a while to adjust to the norms of a new environment

In your first few months your primary job is to listen, ask questions, and
learn.

Questions to ask include:

- What does it mean to do a great job versus an average or poor job? Can you
  give me some examples?
- Can you share your impressions of how you think Project X or Meeting Y went?
  Why do you think that?
- I noticed that Z happened the other day... Is  that normal or should I be
  concerned?
- What keeps you up at night? Why?
- How do you determine which things to prioritize?

> You WILL need to invest in building new relationships

Address the elephant in the room: "Since I'm new, you might not feel comfortable
sharing everything with me right away. I hope to earn your trust over time. I'll
start by sharing more about myself, including my biggest failure ever..." -->
Revealing personal vulnerability.

> You don't know the job and what it takes

Be honest with your own manager about what's working for you and what isn't and
understand his expectations for your ramp up.

### The Successor

Advantages are similar to the Apprentice's

#### What to watch out for when being the successor

- It can feel awkward to establish a new dynamic with former peers
- The increase in responsibility can feel overwhelming

Don't be too hard on yourself and ask for support from your new manager as well
as others around you. Be upfront with your colleagues that they should expect a
period of transition as you ramp up.

"Our last manager left big shoes to fill, and while I'll do my best, I expect
I'll go through a few bumps along the way. I want to ask for your help and
support during this period."

> You feel pressure to do things exactly like the former   manager

Change is a prerequisite for improvement, so give yourself permission to move on
from the past. "Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken"

---

After the first three months, things start getting familiar. But time isn't a
substitute for comfort.

## Chapter Three: Leading a small team

> Managing a small team is about mastering a few basic fundamentals: developing
> a healthy manager-report relationship and creating an environment of support

### Everything always goes back to people

Remember: A manager's job is to get better outcomes from a group of people
working together through influencing purpose, people and process;

**What leads people to do great work?**

Flip the question around: What gets in the way of great work? There are only two
things:

1. **Skills**: *People don't know what good work looks like*;
2. **Motivation**: *People know what good work looks like but won't do it*.

The first step to addressing any concerns about lackluster work is diagnosing
the people issues behind it. Is it a matter of motivation or skill? This doesn't
have to be complicated. You can understand this through a series of
conversations with your report:

1. Discuss whether your expectations are aligned
2. Discuss whether it's a matter of motivation

If both of these don't seem to be the problem, then dive in to whether the issue
is with skills.

> Note: The above only works if you can have honest, constructive conversations
> together.

No matter the work you do or the size of your team, knowing how to diagnose and
solve problems with your reports is critical to your shared success. That starts
first and foremost with building a stable foundation for your relationship.

### Trust is the most important ingredient

> "You must trust people, or life becomes impossible."
>
>-- Anton Chekhov

If your reports don't tell you how they're really feeling, you can't help them.
You may miss early warning signs that lead to bigger problems down the road.

You can avoid being blindsided by developing a relationship founded on trust, in
which your reports feel that they can be completely honest with you because they
have no doubt that you truly care about them. You've accomplished this if the
following three statements are true:

1. **_My reports regularly bring their biggest challenges to my attention_**;
2. **_My reports and I regularly give each other critical feedback and it isn't
   taken personally_**;
3. **_My reports would gladly work for me again_**.

### Strive to be human, not a boss

The way you earn trust from your directs is no different from how you earn it
with anyone else, and requires the following few actions:

#### Respect and care about your report

> **Remember this: Managing is caring**

If you don't believe in your heart that someone can succeed, it will be
impossible for you to convey your strong belief in them.

Supporting and caring for someone doesn't mean always agreeing with them or
making excuses for their mistakes.

What caring does mean, however, is doing your best to help your report be
successful and fulfilled in her work. It means taking the time to learn what she
cares about. It means understanding that we are not separate people at work and
at home.

Another nuance of respect is that it must be unconditional because it's about
the *person as a whole* rather than what she does for you.

> It's easy to like and have a great relationship with someone who is kicking
> ass. The harder test is, what happens when she struggles?

**If your report feels that your support and respect are based on her
performance, then it will be hard for her to be honest with you when things are
rocky.**

#### Invest time to help your report

The most precious resource you have is your own time and energy, and when you
spend it on your team, it goes a long way toward building healthy relationships.
This is why 1:1s are such an important part of management.

Discuss in one-on-one meetings:

1. What motivates her;
2. What her long-term career aspirations are;
3. How she's generally feeling about her work, and more.

One-on-One's should be focused on your report and what would help him be more
successful, not on you and what you need.

> The Ideal one-on-one leaves your report feeling that it was useful for her.

**To have stellar 1:1s you need to prepare.**

Ideas to get started:

1. **Discuss top priorities**
2. **Calibrate what "great" looks like**
3. **Share feedback**
4. **Reflect on how things are going**

> Every morning: Scan your calendar and compile a list of questions for each
> person you're meeting with.

**Do NOT presume you know what the problem or solution is.** Too often, attempts
to "help" aren't actually helpful.

Your job as a manager isn't to dole out advice or "save the day" -- it's to
empower your reports to find the answer themselves. Let her lead the 1:1 while
you listen and probe.

Questions to get the conversation moving:

**Identify:** Find topics to discuss

1. What's top of mind for you right now?
2. What priorities are you thinking about this week?
3. What's the best use of our time today?

**Understand:** Once you identify a topic to discuss

1. What does your ideal outcome look like?
2. What's hard for you in getting that outcome?
3. What do you really care about?
4. What do you think is the best course of action?

**Support:** How you can be of greatest **service**

1. How can I help you?
2. What can I do to make you more successful?
3. What was the most useful part of our conversation today?

#### Be honest and transparent about your report's performance

The responsibility falls on you to be honest and transparent when it comes to
how you are evaluating performance.

If she is often wondering, *What does my manager thinks of me?* then you need to
dial up your level of feedback.

#### Admit your own mistakes and growth areas

Apologize. Admit that you screwed up, and **take meaningful action to do better
in the future.**

> People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people
> will never forget how you made them feel.

When we are going through tough times, the thing that's often the most helpful
isn't advice or answers but empathy.

- "I don't know the answer. What do you think?";
- "I want to come clean and apologize for what I did/said the other day";
- "One of my personal growth areas this half is...";
- "I'm afraid I don't know enough to help you with that problem. Here's someone
  you should talk to instead...".

Showing up authentically, with my fears, mistakes, and uncertainties out in the
open rather than swept under the rug, I've been able to build better
relationships with my reports.

### Help people play to their strengths

We humans are wired to see the bad more clearly than the good.

All of us likely remember moments when a kind word about our unique strengths
made us swell with pride and gave us more fuel to achieve our goals.

Recognition for hard work, valuable skills, helpful advice, or good values can
be hugely motivating if it feels genuine and specific.

> "There is one quality that sets truly great managers apart from the rest: they
> discover wat is unique about each person and then capitalize on it. The job of
> a manager... is to turn each person's particular talent into outstanding
> performance."

In the same way that individuals should play to their strengths, so should you
pay attention to your team's top talent. Don't let the worst performers dominate
your time -- try to diagnose, address, and resolve their issues as swiftly as
you can.

Stars on your team may not be clamoring for your attention, but if you help them
to dream bigger and become more capable leaders, you'll be amazed at how much
more your team an do as a whole.

### The one thing you should never tolerate on your team

**_The No Asshole Rule_**

The team becomes *better off* when brilliant assholes leave.

> You can and should hold the bar high for collaboration. Don't compromise your
> values for someone who thinks it's okay to bully others. You and your team
> deserver better.

### You don't always have to make it work

Personal and organizational values play a huge role in whether someone will be
happy on a given team.

Spend a lot of time trying to understand what potential candidates value, as
well as being transparent about what your company and you value.

Each of us ought to be working in an environment that we love with the people
who share our passions.

### Make people moves quickly

Issues of awareness or lack of appreciation can usually be addressed with a
series of honest conversations. But if what motivates a person simply doesn't
jibe with the values of the team, then a bunch of pep talks may relieve
short-term symptoms, but they won't provide a cure.

Similarly, if your report has a fundamental skills gap that is affecting her
ability to do the job well, it's unreasonable to expect that even the best
coaching will turn things around within a few months.

Protecting low performers only increases the damage when, inevitably, a manager
is forced to let them go.

> What I think is brutal and 'false kindness' is keeping people around who
> aren't going to grow and prosper. There's no cruelty like waiting and telling
> people late in their careers that they don't belong.

You have two options at this point: help someone find a new role in your
organization or let him or her go.

Avoid shuffling around people who lack the right skills or who exhibit toxic
behavior.

> Ask yourself: *If this person were not already at the organization, would I
> recommend that another team hire him or her knowing what I know*

When you decide to let someone go, do it respectfully and directly. Don't open
it up to discussion (after all it isn't one), and don't regard it as a failure
on the part of your report. It might even be your failure.

> "Perhaps it's you who shouldn't be his manager, not the other way around."

Caring about people means owning that your relationship is a two-way street.

Be compassionate in examining the past, but focus on the future and don't
prolong the breakup.

## Chapter Four: The Art of Feedback

For a leader, giving feedback -- both when things are going well and when they
aren't -- is one of the most fundamental aspects of the job. Mastering this
skill means that you can knock down two of the biggest barriers preventing your
reports from doing great work -- unclear expectations and inadequate skills --
so that they know exactly where to aim and how to hit the target.

### What does great feedback look like

> Think of the best feedback you've ever received. Why was it so meaningful to
> you?

Feedback is usually meaningful when: *it inspires you to change your behavior,
which results in your life getting better*. Feedback, at its bests, transforms
people in ways they're proud of.

Praise is often more motivating than criticism.

Summary:

1. Set Clear expectations at the Beginning
2. Give Task-Specific Feedback as Frequently as you can
3. Share Behavioral Feedback Thoughtfully and Regularly
4. Collect 360-Degree Feedback for Maximum Objectivity

Extracted from the examples of feedbacks:

1. Frame the consequence/result
2. Give examples for 360-feedback and behavioral feedback
3. Be specific

#### Set Clear expectations at the Beginning

Before any feedback is given, *you should agree on what success looks
like--whether for a given project or for a given time period--get ahead of any
expected issues, and lay the foundation for productive feedback sessions in the
future*.

During this phase, make sure you address the following:

- What a great job looks like for your report, compared to a mediocre or bad
  job;
- What advice you have to help your report get started on the right foot;
- Common pitfalls your report should avoid.

> **Example:** In the first three months on the job, I expect that you'll build
>good relationships with your team, be able to ramp up on a small-scale
>"starter" project, and then share your first design iteration for review. I
>don't expect that you'll get the green light on it right away, but if you do,
>that would be knocking it out of the park.
>
>**Example:**'s what success looks like for the next meeting you run: The
>different options are framed clearly, everyone feels like their point of view
>is well represented, and a decision is made.

#### Give Task-Specific Feedback as Frequently as you can

Task-Specific feedback is the easiest type of feedback to give because it's
focused on *what* rather than the *who*, so it feels less personal.

It is most effective when the action performed is still fresh in your report's
memory, so share it as soon as you can.

> **Example:** That research report you shared yesterday was excellent. The way
>you succinctly summarized the most important findings at the top made it easy
>to process. The particular insight about X was really useful.
>
>**Example:** Quick note about the presentation you gave this morning: I noticed
>you went straight to the proposal without explaining how you got there. This
>made it hard to assess why it was the best path. Next time, try spending a few
>minutes walking through your process and what alternatives you considered.

#### Share Behavioral Feedback Thoughtfully and Regularly

By connecting the dots across multiple examples, you can help people understand
how their unique interests, personalities, and habits affect their ability to
have impact.

Your words need to be thoughtfully considered and supported with specific
examples to explain why you feel that way.

> **Example:** When people ask you questions about your work, your tone is often
>defensive. For example, when Sally left a comment on your code, you replied
>with "just trust me." This disregarded the substance of her feedback and made
>you appear less trustworthy
>
>**Example:** Your recruiting skills are top-notch. Candidates often say they
>leave a conversation with you feeling more inspired that when they began. You
>also have a keen sense for suggesting the right people for the right roles. For
>example, you identified John for project x a year ago and now he is triving.

#### Collect 360-Degree Feedback for Maximum Objectivity

Every quarter for each report send a short email to a handful of his or her
closest collaborators asking:

1. What is X doing especially well that X should do more of?
2. What should X change or stop doing?

360-degree feedback takes more time to gather, so it's not practical to do more
than a handful of times a year.

**Refer to the 360-degree feedbacks often so that people will perceive them as
important.**

> **Example:** Your peers give you a lot of props for how you managed the budget
> crises. This was important and difficult work, and your calm demeanor,
> excellent listening skills, and rational arguments helped the team get to a
> good outcome
>
> **Example:** One of the consistent themes from your 360-feedback is that your
> planned more rigor. An example is how you left out the edge case of senior
> discounts in your pricing proposal, which resulted in incorrect projections.
> This pattern of small errors across your work is starting to undermine your
> credibility.

### Every major disappointment is a failure to set expectations

If the first time a direct hears that he's not meeting expectations is during
his performance review, it's going to feel terrible.

People get the feeling that:

1. The review isn't fair. If things really were so dire, why hasn't this come up
   until now? This must be a mistake.
2. The review is fair, but my manager was negligent and didn't realize I was
   underperforming until the end of the half.
3. The review is fair, but my manager wasn't honest in sharing feedback with me
   along the way, so I didn't have a chance to improve

Either way the direct loses trust in you and your ability to guide him.

Following are examples of how setting expectations early can preempt future
disappointments:

1. Your report has made it clear that she wants a promotion;
2. You've just assigned a challenging new project to your report;
3. Your team has set a goal to launch in a fixed date.

#### Your report has made it clear that she wants a promotion

If you don't think it's likely to happen and you wait until the next performance
review to tell her, she'll have to expend months wondering if she got the
promotion and then be disappointed.

Say right away: "I understand that you want a promotion, but there are gaps that
I am seeing...".

Show you are helping her achieve her goal. Spell out the criteria. Coach her and
give frequent feedback on how she is doing regarding the expectations.

#### You've just assigned a challenging new project to your report

If you frequently drop in and ask for an update or give unsolicited feedback,
you risk making your report feel disempowered.

At the same time, you don't want to wait a month before reviewing the work

At the beginning of the project, let your report know how you're planning to be
involved. Be explicit about the frequency you'd like to review the work. Tell
him which decisions you expect to make, and which he should make.

Managers who proactively lay out what they care about and how they want to
engage in projects rarely encounter those tensions.

#### Your team has set a goal to launch in a fixed date

Your team may resist to tell you directly that a project is out of date. They
might believe they can still turn things around. Or they might fear getting in
trouble.

By setting expectations that you'd like to hear about any concerns with the
launch date as soon as possible, you establish that it's safe to talk about
problems even in the early phases.

Whenever you find yourself deeply disappointed, or disappointing someone else,
ask yourself: Where did I miss out on setting clear expectations, and how might
I do better in the future?

### Your feedback only counts if it makes things better

You might feel accomplished in pointing out a problem, but that's not the point
if doesn't actually help him.

The question that should always be in the back of your mind is: "Does my
feedback lead to the change I'm hoping for?"

Consider if you're doing each of the following:

1. Am I Giving Feedback Often Enough?
2. Is My Feedback Being Heard?
3. Does my Feedback lead to Positive Action?

#### Am I Giving Feedback Often Enough

Before getting deep into the nitty-gritty of the how, the first step is simply
to give feedback more often and remind yourself that you're probably not doing
it enough

Watch out for only ever giving task-specific feedback. People long for
additional attention about them as people, not just their output.

One tactic that may be helpful: Devote a single 1:1 every month to *just*
discussing behavioral feedback and career goals.

#### Is My Feedback Being Heard

What you intend to say and what the listener hears are not always the same.

The best way to make your feedback heard is to make the listener feel safe, and
to show that you're saying it because you care about her and want her to
succeed.

Recognizing what's going well is more likely to change behavior than only
pointing out mistakes.

Some tips:

1. Always get a verbal confirmation on the takeaways and next steps.
2. Summarize via email what you discussed
3. Help the person hear the same message many times and from many sources

Ask people "Would you be comfortable sharing that feedback directly with X?"

#### Does my Feedback lead to Positive Action

1. **Make your feedback as specific as possible**: Use clear examples that get
   at the *why* so it's easier for the recipient to know what you mean
2. **Clarify what success looks and feels like**
3. **Suggest next steps**: Be clear about whether you're setting an expectation
   or merely offering a suggestion. Also, beware of overdoing this--if you're
   always dictating what should happen next, you're not empowering your team to
   learn to solve problems on their own.

### Delivering critical feedback or bad news

You can convey the same point a dozen different ways-by varying your chosen
words, your tone and your body language, or your body language.

Some examples:

1. You're such a screwup. What am I going to do with you?
2. Your work is terrible, and I need to know how you're going to fix it.
3. I'm concerned about the quality of work I've been seeing from you recently.
   Can we talk about that?
4. Your last few deliverables weren't comprehensive enough to hit the mark, so
   let's discuss why that is and how to address it.
5. I have a few questions about your latest work--do you have a moment to walk
   me through it?

**NEVER** engage when you're upset.

At best, framing your worries as questions feels disingenuous, and at worst your
report will miss that you're actually concerned, which means nothing will
change.

The best way to give critical feedback is to deliver it directly and
dispassionately.

Say:

1. What you perceive the issue to be;
2. What made you feel that way and
3. How you'd like to work together to resolve this concern.

If you need a template:

> When I [heard/observed/reflected on] your [action/behavior/output], I felt
> concerned because...
>
> I'd like to understand your perspective and talk about how we can resolve
> this.

Don't try to sugarcoat a tough message or pad it with "softer" points. Lobbing
over a few superficial words of praise to temper a hard message comes off as
insincere.

If you are delivering bad news about a decision, the decision should be the
first hing out of your mouth when you both sit down:

> I've decided to go with somebody else to lead this initiative...

When you give feedback or make a decision, your report may not agree with it.
That's okay. You are the person ultimately held accountable for the output of
your team, and you may have more information or a different perspective on the
right path forward. Acknowledge the disagreement respectfully and move on.
Extract a commitment to fix the problem.

People are not fragile flowers.

Mistakes are inevitable. But when you give feedback well and you help your
report grow as a result, there is not better feeling.

"Feedback is a gift". It costs time and effort to share, but when we have it,
we're better off. So let's give it generously.

## Chapter Five: Managing yourself

Being a great manager is a highly personal journey, and if you don't have a good
handle on yourself, you won't have a good handle on how to best support your
team. No matter what obstacles you face, you first need to get deep with knowing
you-- your strengths, your values, your comfort zones, your blind spots, and
your biases. When you fully understand yourself, you'll know where your true
north lies.

### Everybody feels like an imposter sometimes

*Every* manager feels like an imposter sometimes.

> Ask any new manager about the early days of being a boss--indeed, ask any
> senior executive to recall how he or she felt as a new manager. If you get an
> honest answer, you'll hear a tale of disorientation and, for some,
> overwhelming confusion. The new role didn't feel anything like it was supposed
> to. It felt too big for any person to handle.

As a manager you're often looked to for answers. When sailings get rocky, the
manager is often the first person others turn to so it's common to feel an
intense pressure to know what to do or say. When you don't, you naturally think:
*Am I cut out for this job?*

You are constantly put in the position of doing things you haven't done before.

Management isn't an innate skill. There is no such thing as an "all-around great
manager" who can transition effortlessly between different leadership roles. We
must look at the specific context.

No matter how often imposter syndrome rears its ugle head, it doesn't have to
derail you. In these next sections, we'll look at techniques for how to deal
with the inevitable doubts and discomfort that will arise

### Get to brutal honesty with yourself

Your strengths and weaknesses directly affect how you manager.

Understand what works best with what you have. The first part in understanding
how you lead is to know your strengths--the things you're talented at and love
to do. This is crucial because great management typically comes from playing to
your strengths rather than from fixing your weaknesses.

To find your strengths, ask yourself these questions:

- How would the people who know and like me best (family, significant other,
  close friends) describe me in three words?
- What three qualities do I possess that I am the proudest of?
- When I look back on something I did that was successful, what personal traits
  do I give credit to?
- What are the top three most common pieces of positive feedback that I've
  received from my manager or peers?

To find your weaknesses, ask yourself these questions:

- Whenever my worst inner critic sits on my shoulder, what does she yell at me
  for?
- If a magical fairy were to come and bestow on me three gifts I don't yet have,
  what would they be?
- What are three things that trigger me? (A trigger is a situation that gets me
  more worked up than it should.)
- What are the top three most common pieces of feedback from my manager or peers
  on how I could be more effective?

Once we have our lists, the next step is *calibration*: make sure the view we
have of ourselves matches reality.

To develop our self-awareness and to calibrate our strengths and weaknesses, we
must confront the truth of what we're really like by asking others for their
unvarnished opinions.

Questions to ask your manager:

- What opportunities do you see for me to do more of what I do well? What do you
  think are the biggest things holding me back from having greater impact?
- What skills do you think a hypothetical perfect person in my role would have?
  For each skill, how would you rate me against that ideal on a scale of one to
  five?

Pick 3 to 7 people whom you work closely with and ask them to share feedback:

> **Example of how to ask**: Hey, I value your feedback and I'd like to be a
> more effective team member. Would you be willing to answer the questions
> below? Please be honest as you can because that's what will help me the
> most--I promise nothing you say will offend me. Feedback is a gift, and I'm
> grateful for your taking the time.

Examples of specific questions:

- On our last project together, in what ways did you see me having impact? What
  do you think I could have done to have more impact?
- With my team, what am I doing well that you'd like to see me do more of? What
  should I stop doing?
- One of the things I'm working on is being more decisive. How do you think I am
  doing on that? Any suggestions on how I can do better?

Ask for task-specific feedback to calibrate yourself on specific skills.

- I'm hoping to improve my speaking skills. What do you think wen well with my
  presentation? What would have made it twice as good?

> If we approach challenges with the belief that we can get better at anything
> if we put the effort, then the vicious cycle of anxious self-evaluation will
> be broken. No matter how good or bad we are at any particular skill, the
> notion that it's within our power to improve allows us to approach learning
> with curiosity instead of apprehension.

The perspective you have changes everything. With a fixed mindset, your actions
are governed by fear--fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of being found out
as an imposter. With a growth mindset, you're motivated to seek out the truth
and ask for feedback because you know it's the fastest path to get you where you
want to go.

### Understand yourself at your best and your worst

The next part of understanding yourself is knowing which environments help you
to do your best work and which situations trigger a negative reaction.

Understanding what enables you to be at your best, you're able to change your
habits to make it easier for you to operate in your ideal environment. Changing
this habits will give you a better sense of control.

If you're not sure what your ideal environment looks like, ask yourself the
following:

- Which six-month period of my life did I feel the most energetic and
  productive? What gave me that energy?
- In the past month, what moments stand out as highlights? What conditions
  enabled those moments to happen, and are they re-creatable?
- In the past week, when was I in a state of deep focus? How did I get there?

Next, you need to understand which situations do the opposite, i.e. which
situations trigger an intensely negative reaction that derails your
effectiveness. By knowing what triggers you, you can catch yourself in the
moment and take a step back before responding like a hothead. If I take even
five minutes to calm down, I'm back to being even-keeled.

Triggers occupy the space between your growth area and somebody else's--you
could work on controlling your reactions, but the other person could also
benefit rom hearing your feedback.

To figure out what triggers you, ask yourself:

- When was the last time someone said something that annoyed me more than it did
  others around me? Why did I feel so strongly about it?
- What would my closest friends say my pet peeves are?
- Who have I met that I've immediately been wary of? What made me feel that way?
- What's an example of a time when I've overreacted and later regretted it? What
  made me so worked up in that moment?

Knowing what lifts you up or brings you down is enormously valuable. The work
you do to help yourself operate at your best will lead to many more winning days
on the job.

### Finding your confidence when you're in the pit

On some days you will feel the imposter syndrome so strongly that you might as
well be stuck at the bottom of a dark, deep pit.

In the pit you feel alone. Doubt is your soundtrack and fear is your sustenance.
You second-guess every decision as you search desperately for something solid to
grasp.

There are some tips to leave to escape the pit.

#### Don't beat yourself up for feeling bad

By feeling guilty about the way you feel, you're creating even more stress for
yourself. Recognize that everyone in the world goes through hard times, and give
yourself permission to worry.

Admit that you're feeling bad, declare and own it. Once you do that, you can
start to make progress on addressing the root cause.

#### Repeat after me: "The story I have in my head is probably irrational"

The stories we tel ourselves from a few scant pieces of evidence are often
flat-out wrong. Your co-workers don't think you're an idiot. And, yes, you
deserve this job.

When a negative story takes hold of you, step back and question whether your
interpretation is correct. Are there alternatives views you're not considering?

#### Close your eyes and visualize

We can trick ourselves into getting some of the benefits of an activity simply
by closing our eyes and imagining it in our heads.

*Imagine the anxiety, fear, and confusion you're feeling as not being personal
to you, but universal things that everyone faces.*

*Imagine yourself succeeding widly at something you're nervous about.* The key
to succesful visualization is to make the scene as specific as possible.

*Imagine a time in the past when you took on a hard challenge and knocked it out
 of the park.* Step through that entire experience in vivid detail. Linger in
 particular on that feeling of success at the very end--the pride you felt, the
 compliments you receive, the confidence you gained.

*Imagine a room full of your favorite people telling you what they love about
you.*

*Imagine what your day would feel like if you were out of the Pit.*

Visualization is a powerful tool that doesn't require much--only a few minutes
and a quiet spot to relax. Develop the habit to give yourself a boost of
self-assurance for whatever comes your way.

#### Ask for help from people you can be real with

Admitting your struggles and asking for help is the opposite of weakness--in
fact, it shows courage and self-awareness. You are saying that you care more
about getting yourself toa good place, than you do about your ego.

Whether it's with your family, your best friend, a coach, or a group of trusted
colleagues, find your support group. Use them as your cheerleaders and sounding
board.

#### Celebrate the Little Wins

One way to break out of that negative cycle is to tell yourself a different
story. One idea is to start a journal of *Little Wins.* Every day, jot down
something you did that you were proud of, even if it is small.

Studies show that if you write down five things you're grateful for every nigh,
you'll feel happier in the long run. When you need to build your confidence,
remember to do the same by focusing on all the things that you are doing well.

#### Practice Self-Care by establishing boundaries

Set boundaries by carving out time for the other important aspects of your life.

One exercise you can do is scheduling a fifteen-minute activity at the beginning
and end of the day that isn't related to work. No matter what, always make time
for yourself.

You can't do your best work unless you physically feel your best, so take care
of yourself. It's always worth it.

### Learning to be twice as good

How you can be most effective will depend a lot on you: your strengths and
growth areas, your personality and values. It will also depend on your
organization's goals and culture.

The nature of this individual path means that most of your learning will happen
on the job. Set a lofty goal for yourself: *How can I be twice as good?* Then
maximize your learning through the following.

#### Ask for feedback

If there is a secret sauce to self-improvement, it's to ask for feedback yrom
other people *all the time.*

Remember to ask for both task-specific and behavioral feedback. The more
concrete you are about what you want to know, the better.

Probe at the specifics and make it easy for someone to tell you something
actionable.

> **Example:** "I'm working on making sure my point is clear in the first three
> minutes. Did that come across? How can I make it clearer the next time?

Always thank people for feedback. Eve if you don't agree with what's said,
receive it graciously and recognize that it took effort to give. If others find
you defensive, you'll get less feedback in the future, which will only hurt your
growth.

#### Treat your manager as a Coach

Your own boss should be one of your best sources of learning. The person most
invested in your career isn't him; it's *you*. Your own growth is in your hands,
so if you feel you aren't learning from your manager, ask yourself what you can
do to get the relationship that you want.

We know by now that a manager's job is to help her team get better results. When
you do better, by extension, she does better. Hence, your manager is someone who
is on your side, who wants you to succeed and who is usually willing to invest
her time and energy into helping you. The key is to treat your manager as a
coach, not as a judge.

See 1:1s with your manager as opportunites for focused learning.

#### Make a mentor out of everyone

Nobody wants to be asked, "Will you be my mentor?" because it sounds needy and
time-consuming. But ask for *specific* advice instead, and you'll find tons of
people trying to help.

The people you work with probably all have something valuable to teach you.

We've all benefited from the mentorship of others, so many people are happy to
pay it forward.

#### Set aside time to reflect and set goals

When you're racing full steam ahead and the scenery is zooming past you, it's
hard to comprehend the entirety of your journey.

Reflection doesn't have to be some kind of heavy process. At the end of the day,
you're doing it for your own benefit, so find what works best for you.

One idea is to reserve one hour on your calendar at the end of every week to
think about what you accomplished, what you're satisfied or dissatisfied with,
and what you're taking away for next week.

Set personal goals and do bigger look-backs every six months. At the end of the
next six months, pull up your goals and evaluate how you did. The important
thing is what you learned.

The more your experiences--good or bad--get shaped into lessons and stories that
help you and others the faster your growth trajectory

#### Take advantage of formal training

If you have the opportunity to get formal training, take it. It might seem
obvious that formal training is helpful, but it also rarely feels urgent or
necessary.

When you invest in your personal learning and growth, you're not just investing
in your own future but also the future of your team. The better you are, the
more you're able to support others.

---

Learning how to be a great leader means learning about your superpowers and
flaws, learning how to navigate the obstacles in your head, and learning how to
learn. With these tools comes the confidence that you're meant to be here just
as you are--no masks or pretenses needed--and that you're ready for whatever
changes lie ahead.

## Chapter Six: Amazing meetings

Good meetings are simple and straightforward. You leave them feeling the same
way every time:

- The meeting was a great use of my time
- I learned something new that will help me be more effective at my job.
- I left with a clearer sense of what I should do next.
- Everyone was engaged
- I felt welcomed

Take the responsibility of running and attending meetings seriously and don't
perpetuate a bad meeting culture. Instead, steer precious time you and your
colleagues spend together toward what's truly valuable.

### What is a great outcome for your meeting

*What does a great outcome look like?*

#### Making a Decision

Success here is both getting to a clear decision *and* everyone leaving with a
sense of trust in the process. You don't need consensus, but those whom the
decision affects should feel that the way it was made was efficient and fair.

Everyone on a team ultimately shares the same goals. While people have different
opinions about the best path to take, part of working well together is placing
trust in decision-makers and in a fair process. "Disagree and commit" for the
sake of moving forward quickly.

A great decision making meeting does the following:

- Gets a decision made (obviously)
- Includes the people most directly affected by the decision as well as a
  clearly designated decision-maker
- Presents all credible options objectively and with relevant background
  information, and includes the team's recommendation if there is one
- Gives equal airtime to dissenting opinions and makes people feel that they
  were heard

Here are some bad outcomes to avoid:

- People feel that their side wasn't presented well, so they don't trust the
  resulting decision.
- Decisions take a long time to make, which delays progress. Be wary of spending
  too much time on small, easy-to-reverse decisions.
- Decisions keep flip-flopping back and forth, which makes it hard to trust and
  act on them.
- Too much time is spent trying to get a group to consensus rather than
  escalating quickly to a decision-maker
- Time is wasted on rehashing the same argument twenty different ways

#### Sharing Information

Nowadays with email and chat right at our fingertips, it's less necessary (and
often less efficient) for in-person get-togethers solely focused on the transfer
of knowledge.

Done well, however, there are a few big benefits of informational meetings over
other channels:

1. They allow for more interaction
2. It's more interesting so you can captivate more engagement

A great meeting accomplishes the following:

- Enables the group to feel like they learned something valuable
- Conveys key messages clearly and memorably
- Keeps the audience's attention
- Evokes and intended emotion

#### Providing Feedback

Feedback meetings don't exist to pass or receive judgment but rather to get to
the best outcome.

A great feedback meeting achieves the following:

- Gets everyone on the same page about what success for the project looks like.
- Honestly represents the current status of the work.
- Clearly frames open questions, key decisions, or known concerns to get the
  most helpful feedback.
- Ends with agreed-upon next steps.

#### Generating Ideas

Unfortunately, having twelve people in a room blurt out whatever comes to mind
isn't actually effective for innovation.

The best idea generation comes from understanding that we need *both* time to
think alone *and* time to engage with others.

Preparation and good facilitation is key. A great generative meeting does the
following:

- Produces many diverse, non-obvious solutions through ensuring each participant
  has quiet alone time to think of ideas and write them down (either before or
  during the meeting);
- Considers the totality of ideas from everyone, not just the loudest voices;
- Helps ideas evolve and build off each other through meaningful discussion;
- Ends with clear next steps for how to turn ideas into action.

#### Strengthening Relationships

(Team lunches, dinners, and other social events, as do some 1:1 meetings)

A great team-bonding meeting isn't about the number of hours spent together or
the lavishness of the event. Instead, it enables the following:

- Creates better understanding and trust between participants';
- Encourages people to be open and authentic;
- Makes people feel cared for.

Every meeting should be clear on which of the above it's trying to accomplish.
Don't try to make a single meeting do too much, and remind the group of its
primary purpose when the conversation starts to deviate.

---

Practice clarity and ruthless efficiency with your meetings, and people will
thank you for respecting the sanctity of their time.

### Invite the Right People

You're more likely to have a great meeting if everyone necessary and nobody
extraneous, is there.

Go back to your answer for what a great outcome looks like for your meeting, and
ask yourself: Which people are necessary to make that outcome happen?

### Give people a chance to come prepared

Presenters suffer "the curse of knowledge"--the cognitive bias that makes it
difficult for them to remember what it's like to be a beginner seeing the
content for the first time.

If the goal of the meeting is to make decisions or give feedback, it can be
tough for stakeholders to understand the material well enough in the span of a
single meeting to arrive at thoughtful conclusions.

Ask the organizers to send out any presentations or documents the day before so
that everyone got the chance to process the information in advance.

After the meeting, the follow-ups need to be treated with as much care as the
preparation. A single meeting is not an end unto itself; it is a stepping-stone
in the much longer path of creating something valuable for the world.

In the last few minutes of a meeting, get into the habit of asking, "So before
we break, let's make sure we agree on next steps..."

After the meeting, send out a recap to the attendess with a summary of the
discussion, a list of specific action items and who is responsible for each, and
when the next check-in will be.

### Make it safe for people to contribute

Not everyone is comfortable rattling off whatever's top of mind in front of a
group.

Environments that feel safe, supportive, and nonjudgmental help people find
their voice. It is easier to share when you see verone else doing the same
versus just one or two talkative people. Or, when somebody asked for my opinion
because she was genuinely curious or when we have a good enough relationship
with the other folks resent to know that they wouldn't *actually* think we are
incompetent, even if we say something stupid.

If you are a meeting organizer you will get better results if you can get your
entire group to contribute. This is why it's so important to foster a welcoming
environment for questions, discussions, discourse, and dissent.

To avoid being the emperor with no clothes on, try the following:

#### Be explicit about the norms you want to set

If you want everyone to participate in your meeting, sometimes the easiest
tactic is just to say that directly.

> **Example:** "I'm here to do a Q&A because it's really important to me that we
> can have real talk about all the things happening on our team. But to be
> honest, I don't get the sense that I'm hearing all of your top concerns. So I
> want to say this up front: Hard questions are good! Get them off your chest! I
> promise to be as transparent as I can."

Make it clear that you value transparency and welcome hard questions, many more
people will share them if you do.

#### Change up your meeting format to favor participation

You can combat natural group dynamics by suggesting more structured approaches.

> **Example:** Going around the room. If there is a decision to make among three
>options, you might ask every person which one he or she favors and why. This
>guarantees that no perspectives are left unsaid.
>
>**Example:** The "Post-It note" opening. Before launching into a discussion
>about a complex topic, give everyone a pad of Post-it notes and ask them to
>write down their thoughts on the topic. Then, have the room work in quite
>concentration for about ten to fifteen minutes.

By encouraging people to get their own thoughts down on paper before sharing
them, the barrier to participation is lowered.

#### Manage Equal Airtime

If your meetings tend to be dominated by a few individuals, try mediating the
amount of airtime everyone gets.

Be on the lookout for interruptions. For the overtalkers, be clear but polite in
letting them know that it's time for someone else to get a turn.

It's not always comfortable to interrupt others and manage the flow of
conversaton in this manner, but it sends a strong signal that you believe better
outcomes come from hearing a diversity of perspectives.

#### Get Feedback About Your Meeting

If you're lucky, you'll have a candid team member who will tell you when he or
she feels that your meeting is not a good use of time. Make it a habit of asking
for feedback, especially on recurring meetings with a larger audience.

The key to getting great feedback is being specific about what you want to know
and making it safe for the person to tell you her honest opinion. Leading with
what you suspect may be an issue signals that it's okay for the person to be
critical.

Think back to the best meetings you've had. How did they feel? Favor meetings
with:

1. A friendly and genuinely curious vibe;
2. Where there isn't an invisible layer of tension or pressure hovering over;
3. People feel safe to toss out their crazy ideas or say "I Disagree";
4. Everyone understands that their presence and contributions are appreciated

### Some meetings don't need you and some don't need to exist at all

Ask yourself:

> "Do I need to be in all of these meetings?" 366 For every meeting, be aware of
the following:

1. Did you participate?
2. Were you critical to the outcome?
3. Did you get something meaningful out of being there in person?

Based on that go through a deep calendar cleanse. Purge yourself out of meetings
that you're not contributing to. With the time regained, you will be able to get
to a healthier balance and focus on doing a better job on the things you care
about.

As a manager, your time is precious and finite, so guard it like a dragon guards
its treasure stash. **If you trust that the right outcomes will happen without
you, then you don't need to be there.**

Be on the lookout as well for meetings that don't seem valuable for *anyone*.
They should be canceled or revamped. There is a direct connection between
well-planned meetings (where the right people are invited, the agenda is
organized, and the interactions are useful) and outcomes like team performance
and employee well-being.

If you find yourself in a recurring meeting of questionable value, do everyone
an important service by kindly letting the organizer know. Life's too short to
be wasted in subpar meetings. Aim to make every single one you are a part of
useful, awesome, and energizing so that your team can achieve more together.

## Chapter Seven: Hiring Well

At a growing organization, hiring well is the single most important thing you
can do.

Hiring doesn't just matter at scale--even a single great hire can make a big
difference in your team's outcomes.

Hiring is not a *problem* to be solved but an opportunity to build the future of
your organization.

It's about figuring out how to make your team and your own *life* much much
better. In addition to contributing their talents, our favorite coworkers teach
us new things, inspire and support us, and make going to work a whole lot more
fun. There's nothing more satisfying than meeting someone for the first time,
realizing how awesome they are, and working with them for years to come on
meaningful problems.

At the same time, hiring well is hard. You'll have to meet a lot of frogs in
order to find a good match.

### Design your team intentionally

The solution to both a healthier diet and a better team is to plan ahead.

One exercise you can do every January is to map out where I hope my team will be
by the end of the year. You can create a future org chart, analyze gaps in
skills, strengths, or experiences, and make a list of open roles to hire for. To
do so, ask yourself the following questions:

- How many new people will I add to our team this year (based on company growth,
  expected attrition, budget, priorities, etc.)?
- For each new hire, what level of experience am I looking for?
- Which specific skills or strengths do we need in our team (for example,
  creative thinking, operational excellence, expertise in XYZ, etc.)?
- What traits, past experiences, or personalities would strengthen the diversity
  of our team?

Having a thoughtful, one-year-out organizational plan lets you stay ahead of
hiring needs and gives you a handy framework for evaluating candidates so that
you won't fall into the trap of saying yes to the next person who comes along.

### Hiring is your responsibility

No recruiter can possibly know what an ideal candidate looks like for *your*
team. At the end of the day, *you* are the person who ultimately owns the team
you build.

#### Describe your ideal candidate as precisely as you can

Write the job description yourself and be specific about the skills or
experiences you are looking for.

When your recruiter understands those nuances, he can help you screen for people
who have the qualities you're looking for.

#### Develop a sourcing strategy

Figure out which patterns or keywords you should look for in a resumé.

Sometimes, unusual patterns can lead to amazing candidates.

#### Deliver an Amazing Interview Experience

Even when you don't end up extending an offer, an amazing interview experience
tells prospective hires that you care about the people who might be the future
of your organization.

Avoid these common mistakes:

1. Leaving days or weeks in between next steps;
2. Asking candidates to repeat themselves over and over or
3. Giving them conflicting or confusing information.

#### Show candidates how much you want them

When you decide to extend an offer, it's as much your job as it is the
recruiter's to make the candidate feel that you want her to say yes.

The more senior the candidate, the more critical your involvement is in the
close. Paint a vivid picture of how you see her having impact. Help her
understand why the role is exciting and why she's the perfect person to tackle
these big problems.

#### Hiring is a gamble, but make smart bets

There are reasons why a handful of interviews isn't ever going to be perfectly
reliable predictor of someone's success.

1. The first is that it's impossible to re-create the actual working environment
   of a team in a thirty-minute or hour-long meeting;
2. Second, interviewers bring their personal biases into the evaluation;
3. Finally, the third reason is that people are capable of enormous change.

Hiring someone new is always risky, but be smart about your approach and you'll
raise your chances of success.

#### Examine past examples of similar work

The best--though still imperfect--predictor for how someone will do in the
future is to understand how they've done in the past on similar projects in
similar environments. That's why internships are so valuable; when someone joins
your team for a few months, you get a much better understanding of how they
work.

The next best thing is to dive deeply into their past work.

Ask candidates if they can show you the applications they've developed, the
articles they've written, the pitches they've given, etc., so you can assess the
quality of their output. If what's presented is a team effort, ask for
clarification on which pieces the individual was responsible for.

#### Seek out trusted recommendations

The trustworthiness of your two-hour interview pales in comparison to the
testimony of someone's tried-and-true experience working with that person.

Make sure your team knows you're hiring: "If you could wave a magic wand, who's
your dream candidate for this position?" The list of people you will get is both
a good starting point on who you should reach out to, but also where else you
could be sourcing from--across these recommended people, are there patterns in
skills, companies, or experiences that we should further dig in to?

Ask your network of trusted colleagues if they can help put you in touch with a
mutual connection that they also trust.

Discount any and all negative feedback that isn't recent. Remember, people
change.

Go back to your definition of the ideal person for the role and make sure you're
casting the net wide enough.

#### Get multiple interviewers involved

Having multiple interviewers can reduce bias and catch subtle red flags that
anyh one person might have missed. When debriefing, however, each person should
independently record their rationale and their final "hire" or "no hire"
decision before hearing other interviewers' thoughts to ensure that the
discussion doesn't lead to groupthink.

#### Look for passionate advocates rather than consensus

Since every hire is already a gamble, **reject any weak hires.** While they're
not likely to bomb, they're also not likely to add much. If you're going to make
a bet, bet on someone with a passionate advocate behind her. If a candidate gets
mixed reviews but all the interviewers that said hire are adamant about wanting
to work with her, it's usually a sign that she brings something highly valued to
the table.

#### Prepare your interview questions ahead of time

The best interviews happen when you show up with a clear sense of what you want
to learn about the person. This means that you should familiarize yourself with
their background and have a list of questions prepared. If multiple candidates
are interviewing for the same role, ask each candidate the same things.

Some example questions:

- *What kinds of challenges are interesting to you and why? Can you describe a
  favorite project?* This tells you what the candidate is passionate about
- *What do you consider your greatest strengths? What would your peers agree are
  your areas of growth?* This questions gets both a candidate's self-awareness
  and what his actual strengths and weaknesses might be.
- *Imagine yourself in three years. What do you hope will be different about you
  then compared to now?* This lets you understand the candidate's ambitions as
  well as how goal oriented and self-reflective she is.
- *What was the hardest conflict you've had in the past year? How did it end,
  and what did you learn from the experience?* This gives you a sense of how the
  candidate works with other people and how he approaches conflict.
- *What's something that's inspired you in your work recently?* This sheds light
  on what the candidate thinks is interesting or valuable.

#### Reject anyone who exhibits toxic behavior

Be on the lookout for warning signs in interviews:

1. Bad-mouthing past employers;
2. Blaming failures they were associated with on others;
3. Insulting other groups of people;
4. Asking what the company can do for them instead of the reverse;
5. Coming across with high arrogance or low self-awareness

#### Build a team with diverse perspectives

Prioritizing diversity isn't just a poster or a slogan. It's the belief that
diversity in all aspects--from gender to race to work history to life
experiences--leads to better ideas and better results.

Prioritizing diversity means that you actively seek out candidates who offer
something different. It means not just promoting from within but also hiring
from the outside. And it means recognizing that every single person, you and me
included, comes with his or her own bag of beliefs that should be challenged by
others. The power of diversity helps our team avoid biases, make better
decisions, and think more creatively.

#### Hire people who are capable of more

Hiring someone who seems to offer more than what the role needs right now means
they can help you tackle bigger problems in the future. **_There are ALWAYS
enough big problems for all the talented people you have_**, often you will have
more big problems than talented people.

As a manager, one of the smartest ways to multiply your team's impact is to hire
the best people and empower them to do more and more until you stretch the
limits of their capabilities.

#### Meeting frogs is part of the deal, but believe in the process

If you zoom out a little further, the recruiting progress can be simply
understood as a funnel of numbers.

The more time and energy you spend on recruiting, the more it pays off, even if
a few specific instances here and there don't work out.

### Hiring when you need five, ten, or hundreds of people

Hiring is not dissimilar to tackling a design problem. When you start, you don't
know what the answer is or how long it will take. But you trust in the process.
If you put in the time and energy--if you come up with ten different design
options, say, or if you talk to ten candidates--eventually you will find the
best solution. You always do.

When your team is growing swiftly, hiring becomes easily the top one or two most
important skills. You can't create great outcomes without consistently
attracting talented people and ensuring that they can also hire well.

#### Successful Hiring is all about diligent execution

Your task then becomes to create a well-oiled machine in which all the steps in
the recruiting funnel happen smoothly and efficiently.

Look also for opportunities to make your funnel more efficient. Can you tweak
your initial email to be mroe compelling so that you get more responses? Can you
host events so that prospective candidates are more likely to want to interview?
Can you come up with better questions to ask that give you more information
about a candidate?

Your success depend on how well you operate.

#### Do your research when hiring leaders

Hiring a manager or senior contributor onto your team is a big investment, and
bad leadership hires are disproportionately more disruptive because they affect
more people.

It's wise not to rush into leadership hires, and instead make sure you know what
an ideal applicant looks like. The easiest way to do that is to talk with as
many prospective candidates as you can, including those who may not want the job
but know the role well.

Learn from specialists:

- What do they look for in a resumé?
- What questions do they ask in interviews, and what kinds of answers are they
  looking for?
- Do they have any recommendations on where to look for strong candidates?

When you make a great leadership hire, the impact on your team is enormous for
years to come. Don't approach it willynilly--it pays to do your research.

#### Take the long view with top talent

Recruiting top talent is all about the relationships you build.

Attracting the best people is a long-term investment. Pay attention to the
rising starts of yur field and get to know them through conferences, mixers, and
other events. Contrinously build you network. And develop your team's reputation
as well, whether through participating in the community, contributing new
learnings to your field, telling your story to the press, or simply through
being known as a class act.

Tell people who turn you down that you hope your paths cross again.

#### Build a great bench

Having a great bench is one of the strongest signs of stella leadership because
it means the team you've built can steer the ship and thrive, even if you are
not at the helm.

More important, a strong bench fress up a manager to tackle the next big hill on
the horizon.

The job your team does shouldn't be static--as the gorup becomes capable of
more, your ambitions should also grow. What is the next big problem that your
team can take on, and how can you help make it happen?

#### Create a culture that prioritizes hiring well

If you team is growing to the point of needing more managers, the responsibility
of hiring must become shared.

You have the chance to establish a culture that outlasts you and carries forth
your values ata a broader scale. To do this, pay close attention to how you set
the tone for hiring

Repeatedly talk about your values so that everyone understand what great talent
looks like. Make it clear that building the team isn't just one person's job,
it's everyone's job.

## Chapter Eight: Making Things Happen

The path to success is never a straight line. It's not about having the single,
brilliant, lighting-flash insight that suddenly wins the game. Instead, it's
about consistent planning and execution--you try what seems like a good idea.
You do it quickly. You keep your mind open and curious. You learn. Then you
scrap what failed and double down on what's working. The process is what makes
things happen.

Good process is what helps us execute at our best. We learn from our mistakes,
move quickly, and make smarter decisions for the future.

### Start with a concrete vision

Tangible visions have the most impact.

An inspiring vision is bold. It doesn't hedge. You know instantly whether you've
hit it or not because it's measurable. And it's easily repeated, from one person
to the next to the next. It doesn't describe the *how*--your team will figure
that out--it simply describes what the outcome will be. I tell my team that I'll
know they did a good job describing their vision if I randomly ask five people
who've heard it to repeat it to me and they all say the exact same thing.

As a manager, it's important to define and share a concrete vision for your team
that describes what you're collectively trying to achieve.

To get started, ask yourself the following:

- Assume you have a magic wand that makes everything your team does go
  perfectly. What do you hope will be different in two or three years compared
  to now?
- How would you want someone who works on an adjacent team to describe what your
  team does? What do you hope will be your team's reputation in a few years? How
  far off is that from where things are today?
- What unique superpower(s) does your team have? When you're at your best, how
  are you creating value? What would it look like for your team to be twice as
  good? Five times as good?
- If you had to create a quick litmus test that anyone could use to assess
  whether your team was doing a poor job, a mediocre job, or a kick-ass job,
  what would that litmus test be?

### Create a Believable Game Plan

Now you have to figure out a plan--also known as creating a strategy--to make
those outcomes real.

Though surprises happen and not everything is within our control, it's through
the process of planning that we make sense of our situation and plot our best
shot at success.

Any good strategy must have a realistic shot at working.

A good strategy understands the crux of the problem it's trying to solve. It
focuses a team's unique strengths, resources, and energy on what matters the
most in achieving its goals.

#### Craft a plan based on your team's strengths

Just as your management style reflects who you are and what you're good at, so
too should your plans take into account your team's unique capabilities.

While many people on our team *can*, that doesn't mean we *should*.

The plan that is smartest for your team is the one that acknowledges your
relative strengths and weaknesses.

#### Focus on doing a few things well

The majority of your result will come from a minority of the causes. THe key is
identifying which things matter the most.

"Few people take objectives really seriously. They put average effort into too
many things, rather than superior thought and effort into a few important
things. People who achieve the most are selective as well as determined."

Prioritization is key, and it's an essential managerial skill.

The best way to practice prioritization is to order any list you make by
importance. Make sure that the things at the top are taken care of before you
venture further down the list.

Effort doesn't count; results are what matter.

> "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But
> that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good
> ideas that there are. You ahve to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the
> things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to
> 1000 things."

#### Define who is responsible for what

When ownership is not clear, things slip through the cracks.

Even when people have the best of intentions, fuzziness around role definition
can create problems.

The clearer you are about whom you're holding accountable for what, the less of
a chance there is for ambiguity and crossed wires.

#### Break down a big goal into smaller pieces

"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

Nothing worthwhile happens overnight. Every big dream is the culmination of
thousands of tiny steps forward.

Treat big projects like a series of smaller projects.

Worry about what's in front of you--don't worry yet about what's months or years
ahead. Then work with your team to set realistic and ambitious target dates for
each milestone. Allot a bugger for dealing with unexpected issues.

From your target date, work backward and figure out who needs to do what every
week. Ask people to set and publicly commit to their weekly goals--this creates
accountability.

"Work contracts to fit the time we give it." There is always a way to break down
what seems like an impossible journey into a series of days, miles, and finally
steps.

### Perfect execution over perfect strategy

Well, if your strategy is bad, then you'll make a move on a chessboard that
opens you up to attack. But if your execution is bad, then your intended "Rook
to E5" somehow becomes "Bishop to D10" because you're trying to play chess with
your feet instead of your hands.

The best plans don't matter if you can't achieve them accurately or quickly
enough to make a difference.

Throughout your career, you will make countless mistakes. The most frustrating
will be the ones where you don't learn anything because it's not clear whether
the issue is with the strategy or with the execution.

The most brilliant plans in the world won't help you succeed if you can't bring
them to life. Executing well means that you pick a reasonable direction, move
quickly to learn what works and what doesn't, and make adjustments to get to
your desired outcome.

Here are some ways to tell if your team is executing well:

- Lists of projects or tasks are prioritized from most to least important, with
  the higher-up items receiving more time and attention.
- There is an efficient process for decision-making that everyone understands
  and trusts.
- The team moves quickly, especially with reversible decisions. As Amazon CEO
  Jeff Bezos says, "Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around
  70% of the information you wish you ahd. If you wait for the 90%, in most
  cases, you're probably being slow."
- After a decision is made, everyone commits (even those who disagree) and moves
  speedily to make it happen. Without new information, there is no
  second-guessing the decision, no pocket vetoing, and no foot dragging
- When important new information surfaces, there is an expedient process to
  examine if and how current plans should change as a result.
- Every task has a *who* and a *by when*. Owners set and reliably deliver on
  commitments.
- The team is resilient and constantly seeking to learn. Every failure makes the
  team stronger because they don't make the same mistake twice.

#### Balancing short-term and long-term outcomes

Being great at making things happen means recognizing the pragmatic realities of
the next day, week, or month as well as the direction you want to steer the ship
in the next one, three, or ten years.

Management is all about the art of balance. If you only think about the next
three months, you might make shortsighted decisions that create problems down
the road. On the flip side, if you're always thinking many years out, you might
struggle with speedy day-to-day execution.

#### Define a Long-Term vision and work backward

"If you don't know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else."

Start by understanding the bigger picture:

- What problems are you hoping to solve with what you're doing?
- How do you imagine people will get value out of your work?
- Based on that, what are the most important priorities for the team now?

#### Take a Portfolio Approach

One question that is common is "How can I carve out time to focus on long-term
work when there's so much to do right now to keep the trains running?"

It doesn't have to be one vs the other. Diversify.

You can have a third of the team working on projects that can be completed on
the order of weeks, another third working on medium-term projects that may take
months, and finally, the last third works on innovative, early-stage ideas whose
impact won't be seen for months or years.

Make constant improvements to current features, while also casting an eye
towards the horizon.

#### Talk about how everything relates to the vision

If everyone understands and buys into what they are ultimately trying to do, the
tactical, day-to-day decisions become easier because you can look at them
through the lens of: "Which option moves us closer toward the future that we
want?" When people don't understand what ultimately matters and why, that's when
conflict arise.

It is important to communicate a clear vision and to foster a deep sense of
purpose within your team.

It's so important to remind people of what really matters. Describe over and
over again the world you'd like to see. Try to connect every task, project,
decision, or goal with the organization's higher-level purpose. If everyone
understands the dream, then the team's actions will be aligned in making it a
reality.

### Good process is ever evolving

There is no such thing as "finished". If we can dream better, we can do better.

This is true not just for products, but also process. The way we make progress
should also be a work in progress.

One of the most useful tools for improving process is the practice of doing
debriefs (also called retrospectives or postmortems).

There is something to learn even if the outcome of a period was positive. If the
outcome wasn't positive, retrospectives help you not make the same mistakes
again.

The goal of retrospectives is not judgement. To achieve this you must:

1. Create a safe environment to have open and honest discussions.
2. Present the facts as objectively as possible.
3. Use language that takes collective accountability instead of pointing
   fingers.
4. Set the tone that it's okay for us to talk about and learn from errors.

After the retro, it's a good idea to write down the learnings and share them
widely. A team growing hardy from its own successes and missteps is great, but
when they can also help others improve or avoid similar errors, that's even
better. A resilient organization isn't one that never makes mistakes but rather
one whose mistakes make it stronger over time.

Resilient processes also try to create repeatable best practices.

Any feat of complexity requires a playbook that lays out in clear detail what
all the right steps are given the current variables.

As a manager, part of your job will be the cultivation of such playbooks: how to
run a team meeting, how to close a new hire, how to complete a project on time
and on budget. If you find yourself doing a similar thing over and over again,
chances are good that it can be codified into an instruction manual or checklist
that can make the task go smoother in the future.

In the process of navigating your river, you might slip. You might fall in. YOu
might have to start over again. But, hopefully, you are made wiser. Take a
moment to reflect on what you've learned and how you might plan that next
crossing. And may you boldly saunter across rushing water the next time it meets
your path.

## Chapter Nine: Leading a Growing team

In a growing team the only way to stay effective is to constantly change and
adapt.

Your frontline view of how a team works starts to evolve into a macro view.
Setting a vision, hiring leaders, delegating responsibility, and managing
communication become the key skills needed to bridge the gap.

### Big teams versus small teams

There are striking contrasts between managing them

#### Direct to Indirect Management

If your team is five people, you can develop a personal relationship with each
individual.

If your team is thirty people, you can't manage them all directly.

When you get more than eight reports, it's normal to start feeling like you
don't have enough hours in the day to support everyone well while also thinking
about hiring, ensuring high-quality work, and contributing to product strategy.
This is why managers in growing teams eventually start to hire or develop
managers underneath them.

You're still responsible for your team's outcomes, but you can't be in all the
details. Decisions will be made without your input, and things will be done
differently than how you might personally do them.

Empowering your leaders is a necessity. One of the biggest challenges of
managing at scale is finding the right balance between going deep on a problem
and stepping back and trusting others to take care of it.

#### People treat you differently

When people don't know you well and see that you're in a position of authority,
they're less likely to tell you the ugly truth or challenge you we they think
you're wrong, even if you'd like them to. They might think it's your prerogative
to call the shots. They might not want to disappoint you or have you think badly
of them. Or they might be trying to make your life easier by not burdening you
with new problems or imposing on your time.

Be aware of this dynamic in your interactions with others. Are your suggestions
being taken as orders? Are your questions coming off as judgement? Are your
presuming that things are rosier than they really are because you're not hearing
the full story?

Emphasize that you welcome dissenting opinions and reward those who express
them. Own your mistakes and remind your team that you are human, just like
everyone else. Use language that invites discussion: "I may be totally wrong
here, so tell me if you disagree. My opinion is...". Ask directly for advice:
"If you were me in that situation, what would you do?"

#### Context switching all day every day

You need to understand that **switching all the time is the job.** As the number
of projects you are responsible for doubles, triples, and quadruples, your
ability to context switch also needs to keep pace. There are techniques that can
make it easier:

1. Scanning through your calendar every morning and preparing each meeting
2. Developing robust note-taking and task-management systems
3. Finding pockets for reflection at the end of every week

There will always be a dozen different issues to work through at any given
time-- some big, some small, and some unexpected-- and as the manager of a large
team, you learn to roll with it.

#### You pick and choose your battles

The more you look after, the more likely it is that something under your purview
isn't going as well as it could be.

At the end of the day, you are only one individual with a limited amount of
time. You can't do everything, so you must prioritize. What are the most
important topics for you to pay attention to, and where are you going to draw
the line? Perfectionism is **not an option**.

#### The skills that matter become more and more people-centric

As teams grow, managers spend less of their day-to-day on the specific craft of
their discipline. What matters more is that they can get the best out of a group
of people.

At higher levels of management, the job starts to converge regardless of
background. Success becomes more and more about mastering a few key skills:
hiring exception leaders, building self-reliant teams, establishing a clear
vision, and communicating well.

### The tightrope act of great delegation

> "To me, the most rewarding part of growing my team has been watching our
> collective capabilities extend far beyond what any one of us could have
> achieved. But, on the flip side, the hardest part has been learning how to
> effectively delegate. "The art of knowing when to dive in yourself and when to
> step back and entrust others". Like crossing a tightrope while blindfolded,
> the balance is difficult to sustain.

Dive in too much and you're the micromanager. Step back too much, you're the
absentee manager.

In the real world, we're rarely at the extremes. But we do tend to lean one way
or the other based on our values.

It's also common to lean different ways in different aspects of the job
depending on where your team is.

### Giving people big problems is a sign of trust

It may be within your power to solve a wide variety of issues, but as a single
individual, you can't solve *that many* of them. The best work comes from those
who have the time to live and breathe a problem fully, who can dedicate
themselves to finding the best solution.

The most talented employees aren't looking for special treatment or "easy"
projects. They *want* to be challenged. There is no greater sign of trust than
handing your report an intricately tangled knot that you believe she can pull
apart, even if you're not sure how.

You need to *actually* believe your report is capable of solving the problem. If
that's the case, give it to her and step back so she has the space to lead. Tell
everyone else that she should now be considered the owner of the problem. Doing
so creates accountability, but more important, the public declaration empowers
the delegate.

Delegating a hard problem doesn't mean you simply walk away.

### Two heads, one shared vision

Doing status checks and technical knowledge transfer during 1:1s is poor
management practice for many reasons. One-on-ones aren't for the manager's
benefit; they should be abotu what's helpful for the other person. It's
unrealistic to expect that you should know all the details of your report's
day-to-day, especially as your team grows and your reports are managers juggling
their own long list of responsibilities.

What you *should* expect is that you see eye to eye on what's most important.

To create a shared vision of what's important, ask yourself:

1. *What are the biggest priorities right now for our team?*: Talk about these
   with your reports and discuss how they might play a role.
2. *Are we aligned in how we think about people, purpose, and process?*

People trump projects--a great team is a pre-requisite for great work.

Beyond people, you and your report should be aligned on why you're doing what
you're doing and what success looks like.

Constantly talking about the purpose with your reports makes it more vivid in
everyone's minds. When the vision is clear, the right actions tend to follow.

Lastly are your reports establishing healthy processes for their teams? Whether
it's advice on how to pitch new ideas, best practices for communicating imporant
updates, discussions on meting dos and don'ts. Whenever you talk about how to
best get things done, it will feel like a valuable use of your time.

### What to do when a manager struggles

Part of delegating well is recognizing that your reports--like you--will make
mistakes and doubt themselves, and that often the best thing you can do is to
belive in them.

A manager's job is to be a positive multiplier for her team. When se isn't, the
costs are high: projects take longer because she inserts herself at the wrong
times, outcomes are poor because she makes bad calls, or complaints pile up
because her people aren't getting what they need.

Even when a manager isn't actively making things worse, she may still be holding
the team back.

The end goal of management is to *get better outcomes*.When someone isn't a
great fit for his role, there is a cost. Would you rather pay it by making a
hard move or by passing it on to other team members and customers?

> "Assume the role was open. Would you rather rehire your current leader or take
> a gamble on someone else?"

The most important question is: *What's going to make the team more successful
over the next few years?*

Change is hard, but trust your instincts. Would you hire this person again if
the role were open? If the answer is no, make the move.

### Aim to put yourself out of a job

Growing great teams means that you are constantly looking for ways to replace
yourself in the job you are currently doing.

> "Try to double your leadership capacity every year."

The point of being a manager is not to satisfy your own ego; it's to improve the
outcomes of your team.

Spend you time and energy on the intersection of:

1. What's most important to the organization and
2. What you're uniquely able to do better than anyone else.

From this, you can extrapolate that anything your report can do just as well or
better than you, you should delegate.

For the things that you do better than your reports, unless it falls into the
"most important priorities" bucket or you don't believe they are set up to
succeed, you should still try to delegate as much as possible and coach them
along the way.

As for what you shouldn't delegate, consider the unique value you're able to add
when it comes to the organization's top priorities.

Beyond your individual superpowers, there are a few other patterns that lie at
the intersection of "important to the organization" and "you can add unique
value".

1. **_Identifying and communicating what matters_**. Your role has broader
   scope, which means that you're able to see across a wider variety of work and
   spot patterns that your reports might miss.
2. **_Hiring top talent_**. Because prospective candidates are generally
   interested in talking with senior leaders, you have an advantage when it
   comes to finding and closing talent. I attend industry events and speak at
   conferences so that I can attract people to our team.
3. **_Resolving conflicts within your group_**

> "If you delegated everything you did today to someone else, do you think
> there'd be no more problems left for you to solve?"

As long as you continue to be motivated by your purpose, as long as your
aspirations extend beyond new challenges on the horizon, then there's
opportunity for you to have more impact. Often, this means doing new things that
you're not very good at yet.

The act of constantly trying to replace yourself means that you create openings
to stretch both your leaders and yourself.

## Chapter Ten: Nurturing Culture

An organization's culture is best understood not from reading what's written on
its corporate website but from seeing what it's willing ot give up for its
values.

Operating with full ownership has its trade-offs.

*Culture* describes the norms and values that govern how things get done. It's
not just about *my* relationship to the team. It's also about their
relationships with each other, and with the group as a whole.

As you manage more and more people, you'll play a bigger role in shaping
culture. Don't underestimate the influence that you can have. Your actions
reinforce what the company vlaues. The next few sections guide you through how
to establish the kind of culture that you're proud of.

### Know the kind of team you want to be a part of

Your team's culture is like its personality. It exists whether or not you think
about it. If you're not satisfied with how your team works together it's worth
examining why this might be and what you can do about it.

The key is to find the intersection between what your team does well and what
you hope the team values. Grab a pen and jot down your answers to the following
questionsL

#### Understanding your current team

- What are the first three adjectives that come to mind when describing the
  personality of your team?
- What moments made you fell most proud to be part of your team? Why?
- What does your team do better than the majority of other teams out there?
- If you picked five random members of your team and individually asked each
  person, "What does your team value?" what would you hear?
- How similar is your team's culture to the broader organization's culture?
- Imagine a journalist scrutinizing your team. What would she say your team does
  well or not well?
- When people complain about how things work, what are the top three things that
  they bring up?

#### Understanding your aspirations

- Describe the top five adjectives you'd want an external observer to use to
  describe your team's culture. Why those?
- Now imagine those five adjectives sitting on a double-edged sword. What do you
  imagine are the pitfalls that come from ruthless adherence to those qualities?
  Are those acceptable to you?
- Make a list of the aspects of culture that you admire about other teams or
  organizations. Why do you admire them? What downside does that team tolerate
  as a result?
- Make a list of the aspects of culture that you wouldn't want to emulate from
  other teams or companies. Why not?

#### Understanding the difference

- On a scale from one to nine, with nine being "we're 100 percent there" and one
  being "this is the opposite of our team," how close is your current team from
  your aspirations?
- What shows up as both a strength of your team as well as a quality you value
  highly?
- Where are the biggest gaps between your current team culture and your
  aspirations?
- What are the obstacles that might get in the way of reaching your aspirations?
  How will you address them?
- Imagine how you want your team to work in a year's time. How would you
  describe to a report what you hope will be different then compared to now?

Depending on what's within your control, some of your aspirations may be doable
and some unrealistic.

Subcultures can grow and flourish within a larger organization.

Once you've identified the values you want to nurture within your team, the next
step is to develop a game plan to help those values flourish.

### Never stop talking about what's important

When you value something deeply, don't shy away from talking about it. Instead,
embrace telling people why it's important to you. Assume that for the message to
stick, it should be heard ten different times and said in ten different ways.
The more you can enlist others to help spread your message, the more likely it
is to have an impact.

The more frequently and passionately you talk about what's important to
you--including your missteps and what you've learned through them--the more
positively your team will respond. Even when people disagree with you, the act
of discussing it openly sheds light on the topic for everyone.

People will not finding this annoying or condescending. Instead, talking about
your values makes you a more authentic and inspiring leader.

### Always walk the walk

People watch their bosses closely to understand the team's values and norms. Our
radars are fine-tuned to spot instances where someone in a position of authority
says one thing and does another. This is one of the fastest ways to lose trust.

If you're not willing ot change your behavior for a stated value, then don't
bring it up in the first place.

If you say something is important to you and you'd like the rest of your team to
care about it, be the first person to live that value. Otherwise, don't be
surprised when nobody else does either.

### Create the right incentives

The final piece is ensuring that your environment rewards people who behave
according to your team's values and holds people accountable when they don't

If the incentives don't match you need to dig deeper to understand what's
sending that message. What actions or results does your team celebrate, and
where does it draw the line?

Sometimes, even the best intentions can lead to bad incentives

You need to be wary of seemingly simple incentive rules that promise amazing
results. They are rarely simple, and often leave collateral damage. Usually a
better option is to have a frank discussion about what we should value and
*why*. Why should we care about exploring more designs early on? Why should we
care about engineering velocity? Once people understand and buy into those
values, they can make the best decisions on how to apply them.

Common incentive traps to avoid:

- Rewarding Individual Performance over anything else
- Rewarding short-term gains over long-term investments
- Rewarding lack of perceived issues or conflict
- Rewarding the squeaky wheel: Do not offer raises to people who seek jobs at
  other companies

The way to identify and resolve incentive traps is to regularly reflect on what
the difference is between your stated values and how people are actually
behaving on your team. What's leading them to make certain decisions?If you're
not sure ask. *Why did you choose to build these five features instead of the
one that the customers are asking for?* If you learn the issue is primarily
structural make changes to your incentives so that the right behaviors are
rewarded.

If the issue isn't structural, but someone does something that's out of line
with your values, you must still take action.

When a report does something difficult that *is* in the spirit of your team's
values recognize them for it. Acknowledge that it was hard and thank them for
doing the right thing.

### Invent traditions that celebrate your values

There is power in rituals. Beyond slogans or speeches, they create actions
around which team members can bond. And they can be as unique, quirky, and fun
as your team.

As a leader, nurturing culture may not be the first thing on your mind. But
success or failure aren't usually the results of a few sweeping decisions.
Rather, how far you get will be the sum of the millions of actions taken by your
team during the small quotidian moments.

Pay attention to your own actions--the little things you say and do--as well as
what behaviors you are rewarding or discouraging. All of it works together to
tell the story of what you care about and how you believe a great team should
work together.
