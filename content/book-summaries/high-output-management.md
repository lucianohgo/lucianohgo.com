__Book Author__: _[Andrew S. Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove)_

## 1. The Basis of Production:

> “Build and deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, at an acceptable quality level, and at lowest possible cost”
Scheduled - Acceptable - Lowest possible Cost

**Limitting Step**: the step in the overall shape of the production flow that will determine the overall shape of a 
company’s operations. Start with the longest/most difficult/most expensive/most sensitive step and work your way back.

Process - Assembly - Test

Your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources
	-> To do this: Develop a clear understanding of the trade-offs

Detect and fix any problem in a production process __at the lowest-value stage possible__.

__EVERYTHING IS A PROCESS__

## 2. Managing the Breakfast Factory

To run your operation well, you will need a set of good indicators, or measurements. You should always focus your
indicators in Operational Goals

> __Which five pieces of information would you want to look at each day?__

Because indicators direct one’s activities, you should __guard against overreacting__

- PAIR INDICATORS -> Effect x Counter-Effect (Health Metrics)

A genuinely effective indicator will __cover OUTPUT and NOT the ACTIVITY__

Leading Indicators give you one way to look inside the Black Box. You must be able to believe in their validity.

Useful:

- Linearity Indicators
- Trend Indicators
- [Stagger Chart](https://tomtunguz.com/groves-stagger-chart/)

Options:

- Build to order
- Build to forecast

> What works better is to __have every small unit prepare their forecast__. This way people will be responsible for 
performing against their own predictions.

You should always deliberately build a reasonable amount of Slack.

Inventory should be kept at the lowest possible stage

### Assuring Quality:

__Inspections:__

1. Incoming Material Inspection / Receiving Inspection
2. In-Process inspection
3. Final Inspection (outgoing inspection)

> One should NEVER let substandard material proceed if it could cause complete failure (RELIABILITY)

Approach Inspections recognizing the balance between: 

- Desired result + Improved Quality VS Minimum disturbance of the production process
- GATE-LIKE Inspection (Wait at the gate) vs MONITORING STEP Inspection (In-flight)

We should __Lean toward monitoring when experience shows we are not likely to encounter big problems__

__Variable inspections:__ Lower frequency if not encountering problems

> __Dig Deeply into a specific activity, but do not meddle with everything__! If a manager examined everything his various
subordinates did, he would be meddling

Meddling is a waste of time for the most part. It will make subordinates accustomed to NOT being responsible.

### Productivity:

One way to increase productivity is to do whatever we are now doing, but faster:

- Reorganizing work
- Working harder

Other way is Changing the Nature of the work:

- Working Smarter not Harder

__Finding Leverage__:

Arrange the workflow to be characterized by high-leverage activities:

- Automation
- Work simplification:
    - Build a flow chart of your production process
    - Question WHY each step is performed
    - Find inefficiencies

> Stressing OUTPUT is the key to improving productivity. Looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite

## 3. Managerial Leverage

```
Manager’s Output = 
    The Output of his organization +
    The Output of the neighboring organizations under his influence
```

> While the manager’s own work is clearly very important, that in itself does NOT create output

### Manager Activities:

- Information-gathering
- Information-giving
- Decision-Making
- Nudging

ALWAYS: Move to the point where your leverage is bigger

Reports are a medium of self-discipline:

- Writing the report is more important than the reading.
- Preparation is key.

Become a Base of information and use it for leverage: NUDGE & MAKE DECISIONS

Managers are Role Models -> DO VISIBLY

Choose the most effective medium to improve output

Increasing Managerial Leverage:

1. Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities
2. Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities
3. Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with higher leverage

__High-Leverage Activities__:

- When many people are affected by one manager
- When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of
words or actions
- When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information

__Managerial Meddling generates Negative leverage__

### Delegation

>Delegation is an essential aspect of managing

Delegator and Delegatee need to share
  - Common base
  - Common set of operational ideas or notion on how to solve problems
  
Make a conscious decision on what you should and should not delegate

Delegation without follow-through is abdication. Never wash your hands of a task.

Delegate the tasks you’re more familiar with.

Apply Quality principles:
  - Monitor at the lowest possible value stage
  - Variable frequency approach
  - Should be based on TRM

### Manage your time:

- Identify Limiting Steps and focus on them
- Batch things that have a similar context
- Use your calendar as a production planning tool
    - Move towards an active use of your calendar
        - Fill the holes between time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities
    - Say NO to work beyond your capacity
        - Always better to say no earlier rather than later
- Always allow SLACK in your schedule. Things will go wrong.
- Always carry a raw material INVENTORY of projects
    - Things you need to do, but you don’t need to do right away
    - This avoids meddling by keeping you busy
- Try to follow well-established procedures

6~8: Ideal number of subordinates

You can act as a Higher and Lower manager at the same time (Plant Manager acting as Engineering Manager while one isn’t filled)

Too Little people leads to meddling

Strive toward REGULARITY

__Dealing with interruptions__:

- Identify types
- Prepare Standard Responses
- Batch questions and problems for SCHEDULED times
- Push people to make an ACTIVE decision to interrupt you
- “Make something regular out of something irregular”

## 4. Meetings - The Medium of Managerial Work

Process Oriented Meetings

__One-on-Ones__:

- Principal way to maintain a business relationship with directs
- Teaching
- Suggestion of ways to approach work
- Direct provides detailed info about work + concerns
- Regularly Scheduled
- Should be regarded as the direct’s meeting with agenda and tone set by him
- Try to identify potential problems
- Learn and Coach
- Encourage discussion of heart-to-heart issues during one-on-ones
    - Satisfaction with personal performance
    - Frustrations & Obstacles
    - Doubts about career
- Very HIGH leverage activity

__Staff Meetings__:

- Focus should be entirely on: Keeping the discussion on Track
- Should be given by directs, not the supervisor
- Be a moderator and facilitator

__Operation Reviews__:

- Review processes
- Remove Inefficiency: Mission Oriented (Ad-Hoc) Meetings
- Never schedule if not absolutely necessary
- Provide a DETAILED outline of the meeting BEFOREHAND
- Keep to a Minimum!

## 5. Decisions, Decisions

![The free discussion model it shows four quadrants on two axis: Subordinates and Supervisor the axis go from inactive
to active. When the subordinates are active and the supervisor inactive the discussion is on track. When both are
inactive the discussion is sleepy. The supervisor should become active to put the discussion on track when the subordinates
are inactive. When both are active the discussion is off-track](/images/high-output-management/discussion-chart.png)
*The free discussion model - The Supervisor should become active to put the discussion on track, ONLY*

The greater the disagreement the more FREE the discussion needs to be.

Any decision needs to be worked out and reached at the LOWEST COMPETENT LEVEL --> FIND THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE SITUATION

__The Peer-Group Syndrome__:

Peers tend to look for a more senior manager even if he is not the most competent to make the decision

Foster Self-Confidence on members. Remember the directs that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision
or being overruled.

Assign a Chairman to the meeting -> Peer-plus-one. It's best if it's the person who has more at stake

Fear of sounding dumb is paralyzing

Striving for the Output

Don’t push for a decision prematurely. But don’t take too long either.

| Things to always Know Before each decision/meeting | 
|---------------|
| What decision Needs to be made |
| When does it have to be made |
| Who will decide |
| Who will need to be consulted prior to the making of the decision |
| Who will ratify or veto the decision |
| Who will Need to be Informed of the decision |

## 6. Planning Today’s Actions for Tomorrow’s Output

### The planning process

Planning is an everyday activity.

The dynamics of planning can be best understood by going back to our production principles:

* Step 1: Determine the market demand for product;
* Step 2: Establish what the factory will produce if no adjustment is made and
* Step 3: Reconcile the projected factory output with the projected market demand by adjusting the production schedule

Analogous to that, your planning process should consist of:

* Step 1: Establish projected need or demand;
* Step 2: Establish your present status and
* Step 3: What more (or less) do you need to do to supply the need/demand.

### Step 1: Environmental Demand

Your environment is made up of other such groups that directly influence what you do.

You should:

1. Attempt to determine your customers' expectations and their perception of your performance.
2. Keep abreast of technological developments and other alternative ways of doing your job.
3. Evaluate the performance of your vendors
4. Evaluate the performance of other groups in the organization to which you belong

Examine in two frames (present and future) - Difference analysis:

1. What do my customers want from me now?
2. Am I satisfying them?
3. What will they expect from me one year from now?

Focus on the differences between what your environment demands from you now and what it will demand from you in a year
from now.

How you react to this difference is in fact the key outcome of the planning process

DO NOT consider at this stage what steps you need to take to handle matters

### Step 2: Present Status

List:

1. Present capabilities
2. Projects you have in the works

Use the same terms or "currency" in which you stated demand

You NEED to look at timing:

1. When will this projects come out of our "pipeline"?
2. Will every project now moving be completed?

It is prudent to factor some percentage of loss for managerial projects.

### Step 3: What to do to close the gap

1. What do you NEED to do to close the gap?
2. What CAN you do to close the gap?

Factor in WHAT EFFECT your actions will have and WHEN.

The set of actions you decide upon is your _STRATEGY_.

#### Strategy vs Tactics

The most abstract and general summary of the actions planned meaningful to you is strategy.

What you'll do to implement that strategy is your TACTICS.

### The output of the planning process

KEY: The Plan needs to produce tasks that need to be performed _now_ in order to affect _future_ events.

Today's gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past:

> Forcing ourselves to concentrate on the decisions needed to fix today's problem is like scurrying after our car has
already run out of gas.

ANSWER THIS:
What do I have to do TODAY to solve - or better yet avoid - TOMORROW's problem?

The true output of the planning process is the set of tasks it causes to be implemented.

> In other words the output of the planning process is the _decisions_ made and the _actions_ taken as a result of said
>process.

#### How far ahead to look?

You implement only a portion of a plan that lies within the time window between now and the next time you go through the
exercise. I.e.:

1. Examine 5 years if the plan should set the actions for 1 year;
2. Examine the whole year if the plan should set the actions for the quarter;

Be careful NOT to plan too frequently. Allow ourselves time to judge the impact of the decisions we made and whether
they were on the right track. We NEED feedback that will be indispensable to our planning the next time around.

> The idea that planners can be people apart from those implementing the plan simply does not work.

By saying "yes", you are implicitly saying "no" to something else.

### Management by Objectives: The planning process applied to Daily Work

We should know quite well what our environment demands from us.

Management by objectives concentrates on steps 2 and 3 of the planning process and tries very hard to make them specific.

If you don't know where you're going, you will not get there.

1. Where do I want to go? (Answer provides the _objective_)
2. How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones or _key results_)

MBO is design to provide feedback relevant to the specific task at hand. It should tell us *__how__* we are doing so we
can make adjustments in *__whatever__* we are doing if need be.

> For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs.

You should set objectives for a relatively short period.

Your objectives should provide FOCUS. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small.

## 7. The Breakfast Factory Goes National

The centralization-decentralization dichotomy is pervasive.

Here some kind of compromise makes sense.

We do want uniform, high-quality standards everywhere and we will monitor each unit to make sure they are adhered to.

> **The game of management is a team game**: A Manager output is the output of the organizations under his supervision or
influence. Quite often this team is a team of teams where the various individual teams exist in some suitable and
mutually supportive relationship with each other

## 8. Hybrid Organizations

Most middle managers run departments that are a part of a larger organization. The "black boxes" they oversee are
connected to other black boxes.

Organizations can come in two **extreme** forms:

1. Totally _mission-oriented_: Completely decentralized. Each individual business unit pursues what it does - it's
mission - with little tie-in to other units.
2. Totally _functional_: Completely centralized. Centralized units all responsible for their respective activities at
all branch locations.

Autonomy/Responsiveness --> Mission-Oriented
Leverage --> Functional

In the real world we look for a ***COMPROMISE** between the two extremes

> "Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization", Alfred Sloan

Balancing act to get to the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.

### Hybrid

![Hibryd organization chart](/images/high-output-management/hybrid-organization-chart.png)

The form of the overall corporate organization results from a mix of the business divisions, which are mission-oriented,
and the functional groups.

Because each mission-oriented business unit does not have to maintain its own support groups, it can concentrate on a
specific mission. And for that each unit has all the necessary freedom of action and independence.

The functional groups can be viewed as if they were internal subcontractors. Allows the company to take advantage of
the economies of scale tha can be achieved. The expertise of specialists - know-how managers - can be applied across
the breadth of the entire corporation.

*__All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.__*

The shift back and forth between the two types of organizations CAN and SHOULD be initiated to match the operational
styles and aptitudes of the managers running the individual units.

The most important task before such an organization is the optimum and timely allocation of its resources and the 
efficient resolution of conflicts arising over that allocation.

In our business culture, the allocation of shared resources and the reconciliation of the conflicting needs and desires
of the independent business units are theoretically the function of corporate management. Practically, however, the
transaction load is far too heavy to be handled in one place.

The answer lies with middle managers! Because they are:

1. Numerous enough to cover the entire range of operations
2. Very close to the problem we're talking about

Middle managers must:

1. Accept the inevitability of the hybrid organizational form
2. Develop and master the practice through which a hybrid organization can be managed: _dual reporting_

## 9. Dual Reporting

_Matrix Management_:

- Main Goal: If problems happened in one place, they did not subvert the entire schedule. Resources can be diverted from
business units;
- Core idea: A project manager, somebody outside any of the contractors involved, can yield as much influence on the
work of units within a given company as could the company management itself.

Plant Security example: Security personnel reports _jointly_ to the corporate security manager _and_ to the local plant
manager. The first would specify how the job ought to be done, and the second would monitor how it was being performed
day by day

Question that arises: "Could an employee in fact have two bosses?"

- Yes - Joint reporting

The need for dual reporting is actually quite fundamental: We want the immediacy and the operating priorities coming
from the general manager as well as a technical supervisory relationship.

### Peer Group

The technical supervisor role does not need to be filled by a single individual: This can be achieved by a council or
committee formed to tackle issues common to all --> this emulates technical supervision that may be missing from general
managers.

(Is this concept similar to the one of a [guild](https://495p931j9olb2qgq0qvr3fxy-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scaling-operations-at-spotify.jpg), but with accountability towards the guild?)

For this to work: _Voluntary surrender of individual decision making_ to the _group_ is required. Being a member means
you no longer have complete freedom of individual action, because you must go along with the decisions of your peers in
most instances. Depends on trusting the soundness of actions taken by your group of peers

> Trust is a an aspect of the corporate culture. Based on values and beliefs. A strong and positive corporate culture is
absolutely essential if dual reporting and decision-making by peers are to work.

### Making Hybrid Organizations Work

Necessary: Coordinate the mission-oriented units and the functional groups so that the resources of the latter are
allocated and delivered to meet the needs of the former.

This creates a need for process and for the functional groups to understand the needs of their peers.

We must continually subject all established requirements for coordination and consultation to the test of common sense
and mercilessly slash away unnecessary bureaucratic hindrance and apply work simplification to all we do.

However we cannot escape from complexity by playing with reporting arrangements.

### Another Wrinkle: The Two-Plane Organization

Whenever a person becomes involved in coordination we encounter a subtle variation of dual reporting.

A person can appear on two organization charts that serve two separate purposes. Having to use dual reporting, because
they have two supervisors. This group exist in a different plane, having two very distinct hierarquies.

The ability to use someone's skill and know-how in two different capacities makes it possible for that person to exert
a much larger leverage at their company.

The multi-plane organization enables leaders to serve as a foot soldier rather than a general when appropriate and
useful and give the organization important flexibility.

The more varied the nature of the problems we face and the more rapidly things change around us, the more we have to
rely on such specially composed _transitory teams_ to cope with matters.

## 10. Modes of control

Our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means. These are:

1. Free-market forces
2. Contractual Obligations
3. Cultural values

### Free-Market forces

No one is needed to oversee the transaction because everyone is openly serving his own self-interest. To work, the goods
and services bought and sold must possess a very clearly defined dollar value.

For much that changes hands in a work or business environment, value is hard to establish.

### Contractual Obligations

What happens, for instance, when it takes a _group_ of people to accomplish a certain task? If we bought engineering
work by the "bit", we would end up spending more time trying to decide the value of each bit of contribution than the
contribution itself is worth. Here **trying to use free-market concepts become quite inefficient**.

Contractual obligations define the kind of work you will do and the standards that will govern it. Value is hard to
establish, so we must have authority over the work being performed, which implies a right to monitor, evaluate and, if
necessary, correct the work.

We surrender the right to some of what we earn and expect certain services in return.

### Cultural Values

When the **environment changes more rapidly than one can change rules**, or when **a set of circumstances is so
ambiguous and unclear that a contract between the parties that attempted to cover all possibilities would be
prohibitively complicated**, we need a mode of control based on cultural values.

**Most important characteristic**: The interest of the larger group to which and individual belongs takes precedence
over the interest of the individual himself!

Believing in:

1. Shared _values_ &
2. Shared _objectives &_
3. Shared _methods_ &
4. Build _trust_

These can only be developed by a great deal of common, shared experience!

### The Role of Management in the different modes of control

1. Free-Market: Nothing (:
2. Contractual Obligations:
  2.1. Setting and modifying the rules
  2.2. Monitoring adherence to the rules
  2.3. Evaluating and improving performance
3. Cultural Values: Through _articulation_ and _example_; in order to build trust, the manager must develop and nurture
a common set of:
  3.1. Values
  3.2. Objectives
  3.3. Methods

### The Most Appropriate mode of control

There is always a most appropriate mode of control, which we managers should find and use.

There are two dimensions:
1. The nature of a person's motivation: Ranging from Self-Interest to Group Interest
2. The nature of the environment in which she works (Complexity Uncertainty Ambiguity Factor - CUA factor): Ranging from
Low to High
	2.1. Complex: New technology, creating new things, people pulling in different directions
	2.2. Uncertain: One or more important conditions may change
	2.3. Ambiguity: Clear, defining information is missing from key points
	
The image explains this:

![Invidual Motivation Vs CUA Factor. Shows four quadrants along two axis. The axis represent motivation and CUA factor.
When motivation is in the Group's Interest if the CUA factor is low, the mode of control should be contractual
obligation, if the CUA factor is high, it should be based on cultural values. If the motivation is Self-Interest and
the CUA factor is low, it should be Free-Market forces, if the CUA factor is high it simply does not work
](/images/high-output-management/individual-motivation-vs-cua-factor.png)
*Invidual Motivation Vs CUA Factor. Use the appropriate mode of control based on this two dimensions*

### Applying the model to New Employees

- **Motivation:** Usually self-interest
- **Action:** Give her a **very structured job** with a **low CUA factor**.

If he does well --> Group Interest rises. This is why promotion from within is favored in most companies.

When hiring people for high CUA factor jobs: All we can do is cross our fingers and hope she quickly forgets
self-interest and just as quickly gets on top of her job to reduce her CUA factor.

### Modes of control at work

We may find ourselves governed by all three modes of control.

Expectations can be as binding as a legal document --> Contractual Obligations are often implicit.

**Belief** and **faith** are not aspects of the market mode, but stem from adherence to cultural values.

## 11. The Sports Analogy

Reminder: A manager's output is the output of the organization under his supervision or influence. This implies that:

**Management is a team activity**. No matter how well a team is put together, no matter how well it is directed, the
team will perform only as well as the individuals on it.

> Everything we considered so far is useless unless the members of our team will continually try to offer the best they
>can do.

There are only two **reasons why a person is not doing his job**:

1. Can't do it --> Not capable
2. Won't do it --> Not motivated

Test to determine which governs:

"If the person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?".

Yes --> Not motivated
No --> Not capable

> The single **most important task of a manager** is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates.

The two main ways to tackle issues:
1. **Training**
2. **Motivation**

**Motivation has to come within somebody**. All a manager can do is **create an environment in which motivated people
can flourish**. A subordinate saying "I'm motivated" means nothing.

Better motivation means better performance. An attitude may constitute an indicator of human motivation, but it is not
the desired result or output. Better performance at a given skill level is.

![Peformance vs Individual Capability graph. Different levels of motivation will imply different performance curves. The
image shows a graph in which the level of motivation of a person defines the curve on this plane of performance and
individual capacity](/images/high-output-management/performance-vs-capability.png)
*Peformance vs Individual Capability graph - Different levels of motivation will imply different performance curves*

__Manual labor:__

1. Easy and instant to measure
2. Clear expectations

__Knowledge labor:__

1. Hard to measure
2. Not instant to measure
3. Expectations are usually not clear & difficult to state precisely

Fear would hardly ever work well to motivate knowledge work.

_needs_ --> __drives__ --> __motivation__

This implies that: To maintain high motivation **we must keep some needs unsatisfied**

![Maslow pyramid of needs](/images/high-output-management/maslow-hierachy-of-needs-min.jpg)
*[Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)*

> The need to keep up with or emulate someone is a powerful source of positive motivation. Esteem exists in the eye of
the beholder.

### Self-Actualization Needs ("What I can be, I must be")

All other needs are _self-limiting_ => When gratified, the need can no longer motivate the person.

Once someone's source of motivation is Self-Actualization, her drive to perform has no limit.

Two inner forces - drivers for full capability:

1. _Competence-Driven_: Concerns itself with the job or task being performed. Mastery.
2. _Achievement-Driven_: People moved by the need to achieve in everything they do.

Three types of behaviors:

1. Gamblers: High risks, no influence.
2. Conservatives: Very little risk
3. Achievers: Test the limits of what they can do.

=> Some people just _must_ test themselves

Both _Competence-Driven_ and _Achievement-Driven_ people _spontaneously_ test the limits of their abilities.

When the need to stretch is not spontaneous, management needs to create an environment to foster it. Example: Objectives
set just hard enough so that even if people push themselves very hard, they still have a 50 percent chance of
succeeding. Output tends to greater when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond their immediate grasp.

If we want to cultivate achievement-driven motivation, we need to create an environment that **values and emphasizes
output**.

### Money and Task-Relevant Feedback

> Once there is enough money to bring a person up to a level he expects of himself, more money will NOT motivate.

When one is self-actualized, money in itself is no longer a source of motivation but rather a _measure of achievement_.
Money as a measure of achievement will motivate without limit.

Test:

- If the absolute sum of a raise in salary an individual receives is important to him --> Working mostly within the
safety mode.
- If what matters to him is how his raise stacks up against what other people got --> Esteem/Recognition or
Self-Actualization. Money here was a _measure_

Once in the Self-Actualization mode, a person needs measures to gauge his progress and achievement.

**The most important measure is feedback on his performance**.

If the possibility for improvement does not exist, the desire to keep practicing vanishes.

The most appropriate measures tie an employee's performance to the workings of the organization

The most important form o _task relevant feedback_ is the performance review every subordinate should receive from his supervisor.

### Fear

_fear of failure_ can be positive or negative. If it becomes a preoccupation, a person driven by a need to achieve will
simply become conservative.

In the upper levels of motivation: Fear is not something coming from the outside. It is instead fear of not satisfying
yourself that causes you to back off.

You can NOT stay in the self-actualized mode if you're always worried about failure.

### The Sports Analogy

The performance of the organization as a whole depends on how skilled and motivated the people within it are.

Our roles as managers is:

1. First to train them
2. Second to bring them to the point where self-actualization motivation motivates them

Once in that point, motivation will be self-sustaining and limitless.

Why does a person who is not terribly interested in his work at the office stretch himself to the limit running a
marathon? --> _He is trying to beat other people or the stopwatch_

People will exert themselves to previously undreamed heights, forcing themselves to run farther or faster, while their
efforts fill barrels with sweat, to beat the distance, the clock or other people.

**Endow work with the characteristics of competitive sports**:

1. Establish rules of the game
2. Create ways for employees to measure themselves

Eliciting peak performance means going up against something or somebody.

See the work and create indicators --> Create your employees' racetrack!

One of the big impediments to a fully committed, highly motivated state of mind is preoccupation with failure.

The role of a Manager is that of a _Coach_. An ideal coach:

1. Takes NO personal credit for the success of his team;
2. Is tough on his team

A good coach was likely a good player himself at one time

## 12. Task-Relevant Maturity

>No optimal management style exists. High output is associated with particular _combinations_ of certain managers and
>certain groups of workers.

A given managerial approach is not equally effective under all conditions.

One variable that tells you wah the best management style should be: Task Relevant Maturity (TRM) of the directs.

```
TRM =
  Degree of their achievement orientation + Readiness to take responsibility + Education + Training + Experience.
  Very specific to the tasks in hand
```

Same person can have a high TRM for one job and low in another. TRM can be high given a certain level of CUA, but drop
if it changes.

Varying management styles are needed as task-relevant maturity varies.

- Low TRM -- Precise detailed Instructions
- Medium TRM -- Communication, Emotional support & Encouragement
- High TRM -- Focus on have mutual agreed upon objectives, involvement should be kept to a minimum

Regardless of TRM **a manager should always monitor a direct's work closely enough to avoid surprises**. In the absence
of monitoring, we're practicing _abdication_ and not _delegation_.

| TRM of direct | Effective Management Style |
|---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Low | Structured; Task-Oriented;  "What", "How" & "When" |
| Medium | Individual-Oriented; emphasis on two-way communication,  support, mutual reasoning |
| High | Involvement by manager minimal: Establishing objectives and monitoring |
*WARNING 🚨: Do not make judgment of what is "nice" or "not nice". We are after what is most _effective_.*

Structure moves from being _externally imposed_ to being _internally given_.

Commonality of operational values, priorities and preferences is a must if the progression in managerial style is to
occur.

The responsibility for transmitting common values rests squarely with the supervisor. Without a shared set of values a
supervisor cannot effectively delegate.

**The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers
of his organization, internal or external**.

### Management Style and Managerial Leverage

We should try to raise the TRM of our directs as rapidly as possible for obvious pragmatic reasons.

Increasing TRM increases _managerial leverage_

At the highest levels of TRM, the subordinate's training is presumably complete and motivation is likely to come from
within, from self-actualization.

A manager's ability to operate in a style based on communication and mutual understanding depends on there being enough
time for it.

Though monitoring is on paper a manager's most productive approach, we have to work our way up to it in the real world.

If things suddenly change, we have to revert quickly to the what-when-how mode. We often don't take it up until it is
too late and events overwhelm us.

Do not think of any management mode is not either good or bad, but rather as effective or not effective given the TRM
of our directs within a specific work environment.

### It's not easy to be a good manager

Challenges in applying the proper Management Style:

1. Deciding the TRM of your directs is not easy
2. Managers' personal preferences on how to work
3. Managers' images of themselves
4. Difference in perceptions: Sometimes a manager throws out suggestions to a subordinate who receives them as marching
orders

Friendship between supervisor and direct: If you cringe at the thought of giving a tough performance review to your
friend, don't make friends at work. Otherwise, you're likely to be someone whose personal relationships will strengthen
work relationships.

## 13. Performance Appraisal: Manager as Judge & Jury:

> Giving performance reviews is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback for supervisors

Fundamental Purpose: **Improve the direct's performance**

Dedicated to two things:

1. Skill Level
2. Motivation

-> Put your subordinate on a higher performance curve

In general our society values avoiding confrontation

If performance matters, performance reviews are absolutely necessary

Assessing Performance:

Consider:

	Activities -> Subjective
	Output -> Objective

Before Anything:

	Clarify what we expect of that person
	“If we don’t know what we want, we are surely not going to get it”

Find the trade-off:

1. Output Measures: Things we can and should plot on charts
2. Internal Measures: What is being done to create output: Present and Future

i.e. (Long-term vs Short-term) oriented performance. Find best value!

For Managers judge BOTH:

1. His performance and
2. The performance of the groups under his supervision

Force yourself to assess:

1. Performance NOT potential;
2. Actual performance NOT appearances.

Promotion for the best => Performance counts

ALWAYS find a way to suggest improvement. What the subordinate did VS What he might have done.

Step by step:

1. Consider as many aspects as possible
    1. Progress reports
    2. Performance on quarterly objectives
    3. One-on-one meeting notes
    4. …
2. Write everything on paper, do NOT edit, don’t order
    1. Major
    2. Minor
    3. Trivial
3. Find relationships between items
4. Find the whys and turn them into messages
5. Draw conclusions
    1. Find specific examples to support them
6. Delete less important items
    1. Until the list has a size the person can remember
    2. What you couldn't include now, you will still be able to in the future

Preferably, a review should not contain any surprises, but if you uncover one, swallow hard and bring it up

Delivering the Assessment (LLL):

	LEVEL - be frank
	LISTEN - watch, sense, guarantee
	LEAVE yourself out - it is NOT about you

### “On the one Hand … On the other Hand”:

Common Problems:

1. Superficiality
2. Clichés
3. Laundry List of unrelated observations

People have only a finite capacity to deal with facts, issues & suggestions/
The purpose is NOT to cleanse my system of all the truths, it is to improve his performance!

### “The Blast”:

Poor performer - Steps on solving a problem:

1. Ignore
2. Active Denial
3. Blaming others
4. Assuming responsibility
5. Finding a solution

Reviewers Job: Move through ALL the stages up until Assuming Responsibility. Finding a Solution should be a shared task.

Any outcome that includes commitment to action is acceptable

On the job we are after a person’s performance, NOT our psychological comfort

Secure your subordinate’s commitment AND monitor performance

### “Reviewing the Ace”:

For an achiever effort should go into:

1. Justifying the judgment of superior performance
2. How he could have done even better

Spend MORE time improving the performance of the stars

There is ALWAYS room for improvement

Give the subordinate the written review sometime before the face-to-face

## 14. Two difficult tasks

Besides performance review, there are two emotionally charged tasks a manager must perform:

1. Interviewing a potential employee
2. Trying to talk a valued employee out of quitting

### Interviewing

Somethings to know first:
1. Risks of failure are high;
2. References are a tool for assessing potential performance -- bear in mind though that whatever a person says, even if
they are sincere, won't have much meaning if the environments are different. At the same time, most avoid critical
remarks;
3. Reference checks hardly exempt you of getting as much as you can out of the interview

The applicant should do at least 80 percent of the talking during the interview. _What_ he talks about should be your
main concern.

Time is short and limited:

1. Interrupt any answers that you have lost interest on;
2. An interview produces the most insight if you steer the discussion toward subjects familiar to both you and the
candidate.

Talking subjects:

1. Herself;
2. Her experience;
3. What she has done and why;
4. What she would have done differently

This should all be done in terms familiar to you;

Some example questions:
1. Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by levels above your immediate
supervisor;
2. What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?
3. Convince me why my company should hire you.
4. What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them?
What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?
5. Why do you think you're ready for this new job?
6. What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?
7. What do you consider your most significant failures? What did you learn from them?
8. Why do you think an engineer should be chosen for a marketing position? (changing with the situation)
9. What was the most important course or project you completed in your college career? Why was it so important?

What we're after
1. _Technical_ Knowledge;
2. How this person performed in an earlier job _using_ her skills;
3. What she _did_ with what she knows;
4. Reasons why there might be _discrepancy_ between what she knew and what she did;
5. What _operational values_ would guide this person on the job.

| Category | Questions |
|-----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Technical/Skills | describe some projects / what are your weaknesses |
| What she did with knowledge | past achievements / past failures |
| Discrepancies | what did you learn from failures / problems in current position |
| Operational values | why are your ready for the new job / why should my company hire you / why should eng by chosen for mkt / most important college course or project |

The **ultimate purpose of interviewing is to make a judgement about how the candidate would perform in your company's
environment**.

When you're hiring, you must judge potential contribution.

Direct questions get direct answers.

Asking a candidate to handle a hypothetical situation can also enlighten you.

Interviewing should be completely straightforward. Show yourself and the environment as they really are.

Interviewing doesn't guarantee anything, it merely increases your odds of getting lucky.

### Employee quitting

- **What this is not about**: Someone who's motives are more money or better perks at another company.
- **What it is**: About an employee who is dedicated and loyal yet feels his work is not appreciated. Who you and the
company do not want to lose.

If he feels his efforts have gone unrecognized, you have not done your job and have failed as his manager.

Here _your initial reaction to his announcement is absolutely crucial_: In almost all such cases, the employee is
quitting because he feels he is not important to you.

Action plan:

1. Drop what you are doing;
2. Sit him down and ask him _why_ he is quitting;
3. Let him talk and do not argue about anything with him;
4. Ask him more questions: make him talk - after the prepared speech is over, you might hear the real reasons;
5. Don't argue, don't lecture & don't panic: you must convey to him _by what you do_ that he is important to you;
6. Find out what really is troubling him;
7. Don't try to change his mind at this point, but **buy time**;
8. Follow through on whatever you've committed yourself to do.

It is up to you to make it your supervisor's problem and make her participate in the solution to your problem. Go to her
for help and advice.

You must vigorously pursue every avenue available to you to keep him with the firm, even it means transferring him to
different departments.

You owe it to your employer to save an employee for the company.

Go back to your direct with a solution, one that addresses all the real reasons for wanting to quit and one that in turn
will benefit the company.

You **have** to make him feel comfortable with the new arrangement.

If he accepted a position elsewhere already: Say he's really made _two_ commitments: first to a potential employer he
only vaguely knows, and second to you, his present employer. Commitments made to people you know are far stronger than
ones made to casual new acquaintances.

It's not easy, but you must give it your all. The good of the company is involved and the issue is even more important
than keeping one valued employee. Other employees will respect him and identify with him, so other superior performers
like him might follow.

## 15. Compensation as Task-Relevant Feedback

As one moves up the need hierarchy, money begins to mean something else - a measure of one's worth in a competitive
environment.

As a supervisor, you have to be very sensitive toward the various money needs of your directs and show empathy towards
them. You must be especially careful not to project your own circumstances onto others.

As managers, or concern is to get a high level of performance from our directs. So we must **use money as a way to
deliver _task-relevant-feedback_**. Compensation should obviously be tied to performance.

We can base a portion of a middle manager's compensation on his performance: _performance bonus_. The percentage the
bonus represents of a manager's total compensation should rise with his total compensation.

A Bonus needs to be paid close enough to the time the work was done that the direct can remember why it was awarded.

Any merit-based system requires a competitive, comparative evaluation of individuals.

At work competitive ranking frequently becomes a highly charged issue. But yet, we must use salary as a way to encourage
performance.

Promotions must be based on performance because that is the only way to keep the idea of performance highlighted,
maintained and perpetuated.

If we're considering positions, we have to consider the **Peter Principle**: when someone is good at his job, she is
promoted; she keeps getting promoted until she reaches her level of incompetence and then stays there.

An achiever will alternate between the "meets requirements" and the "exceeds requirements" ratings throughout her
career, until she eventually settles at a "meets requirements" level at which time she'll will no longer be promoted.

We really have no choice but to promote until a level of "incompetence" is reached. This way we drive our directs toward
higher performance, and while they may perform at a "meets" level half the time, they will do that at an increasingly
more challenging and difficult job level.

There are times when a person is promoted into a position much over his head that he performs in a below-average fashion
for too long a time. The solution here is to _recycle_ him: put him back on the job he did well. People tend to view it
as a personal failure. In fact, management was at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness for more responsibility.

We managers must be responsible and provide our subordinates with honest performance ratings and honest merit-based
compensation.

## Why Training is the Boss's Job

Insufficiently trained employees, in spite of their best intentions, produce inefficiencies, excess costs, unhappy
customers and peers and sometimes even dangerous situations.

The manager should do the training himself. Training is one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform.

Assuming that the training will accurately address what people need to know.

For training to be effective:

1. It has to be closely tied to how things are actually done in your organization;
2. It has to maintain a reliable, consistent presence: systematic & scheduled => Training should be a process, not an
event;
3. Must be done by a person who represents a suitable __role model__.

Two different kinds of tasks:

1. Teaching new members of our org the skills needed to perform their jobs;
2. Teaching new ideas, principles or skills to the present members of our org.

The distinction is important, because the magnitude of the tasks is very different.

How to start:

1. **Make a list**: Of things you feel your directs or the members of your department should be trained in -- do not
limit the scope
2. **Ask the people**: What they feel they need;
3. Take an inventory of the manager-teachers and instructional material available to help deliver training on items on
your list. Then assign priorities among these items.
4. Start small: One course;
5. Set a schedule for your course, with deadlines, and commit to it;
6. Create an outline for the whole course, develop just the first lecture, and go.
7. After you've given the course, ask for anonymous critiques from the employees in your class.

Your ultimate aim should be to satisfy yourself that you are accomplishing what you set out to do.
